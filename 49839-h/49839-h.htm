<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p>This series of English History Source Books is intended for
use with any ordinary textbook of English History. Experience
has conclusively shown that such apparatus is a valuable&mdash;nay,
an indispensable&mdash;adjunct to the history lesson. It is
capable of two main uses: either by way of lively illustration
at the close of a lesson, or by way of inference-drawing, before
the textbook is read, at the beginning of the lesson. The kind
of problems and exercises that may be based on the documents
are legion, and are admirably illustrated in a <cite>History of England
for Schools</cite>, Part I., by Keatinge and Frazer, pp. 377&ndash;381.
However, we have no wish to prescribe for the teacher the
manner in which he shall exercise his craft, but simply to
provide him and his pupils with materials hitherto not readily
accessible for school purposes. The very moderate price of
the books in this series should bring them within the reach
of every secondary school. Source books enable the pupil to
take a more active part than hitherto in the history lesson.
Here is the apparatus, the raw material: its use we leave to
teacher and taught.</p>

<p>Our belief is that the books may profitably be used by all
grades of historical students between the standards of fourth-form
boys in secondary schools and undergraduates at Universities.
What differentiates students at one extreme from those
at the other is not so much the kind of subject-matter dealt
with, as the amount they can read into or extract from it.</p>

<p>In regard to choice of subject-matter, while trying to satisfy
the natural demand for certain “stock” documents of vital
importance, we hope to introduce much fresh and novel matter.
It is our intention that the majority of the extracts should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
lively in style&mdash;that is, personal, or descriptive, or rhetorical,
or even strongly partisan&mdash;and should not so much profess to
give the truth as supply data for inference. We aim at the
greatest possible variety, and lay under contribution letters,
biographies, ballads and poems, diaries, debates, and newspaper
accounts. Economics, London, municipal, and social
life generally, and local history, are represented in these pages.</p>

<p>The order of the extracts is strictly chronological, each
being numbered, titled, and dated, and its authority given.
The text is modernised, where necessary, to the extent of
leaving no difficulties in reading.</p>

<p>We shall be most grateful to teachers and students who
may send us suggestions for improvement.</p>

<h2 id="chap_1">THE CHARACTER OF THE SAXONS AND NORMANS CONTRASTED.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center b2"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;William of Malmesbury, <cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">De gestis regum Anglorum</cite>,
ed. Stubbs, vol. ii., p. 306. (Rolls Series.)</p>

<p>In the process of time the study of letters and of religion
decayed, many years before the coming of the Normans.
The clergy, content with insufficient learning, could scarcely
stammer the words of the sacraments, and one who understood
grammar was a cause of amazement and wonder to the rest.
The monks made a mock of their rule, wearing fine garments
and eating all kinds of food. The nobles, given over to gluttony
and lust, used not to attend church in the morning in Christian
fashion, but lay in bed till late hours and idly listened to the
service of matins and masses from the lips of a hurrying priest.
The people, unprotected in their midst, were the prey of the
stronger folk, who drained their substance or sold their persons
into distant lands, that they might heap up treasure upon
treasure, albeit excess of feasting rather than of wealth is the
instinct of this race. Many indulged the unnatural custom of
selling their handmaids ... into foreign slavery. They all
used to drink in common, spending whole nights and days in
this practice. They consumed their whole substance in small
and mean houses, unlike the French and Normans, who live
moderately in large and noble dwellings. The vices that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
accompany drunkenness and enfeeble the minds of men ensued.
Hence it came to pass that they encountered William with
headlong rashness and fury rather than with military skill, and
by one battle, and that easily won, doomed themselves and
their country to slavery. Nothing is simpler than rashness,
but that which is impetuously begun speedily comes to nought
or is repressed. In short, the English at that time wore garments
reaching to the middle of the thigh, their hair was cut
short, their beards shaven, their arms laden with golden bracelets,
their skin pricked with pictorial designs; they used to eat till
they were surfeited, and drank till they were sick. These
latter habits indeed they have now passed on to their conquerors,
for the rest, however, adopting the others’ customs.
I would not, however, be understood to ascribe these vices
universally to all the English; I know that there were many
clerks who at that time lived simply and trod the path of holiness;
I know that there were many laymen of the same nation,
of every sort and condition, who were pleasing to God. Let
my narrative escape injustice; all are not alike included in this
condemnation; but as in times of peace the wisdom of God full
often cherishes the evil with the good, so in times of captivity
His sharp displeasure not seldom constrains the good with the
evil.</p>

<p>Now the Normans, to speak of them also, were at that time
and still are in dress bravely apparelled and in their food
delicate but not excessive; a people accustomed to warfare,
and without it scarce able to live. They are fierce in attacking
the enemy, and where strength fails, they achieve their end no
less by craft and bribery. As I have said, at home they live
moderately in large dwellings, they envy their equals, they
would surpass their superiors, and while they plunder their
subjects, they protect them from others; faithful to their lords,
they lightly break faith for a slight offence. They weigh
treachery with its prospect of success, and change their policy
for a bribe. They are, however, the kindliest of all nations
and honour strangers equally with themselves; they also marry
with their subject peoples. At their coming they raised the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
standard of religion, everywhere lifeless in England; on all
sides you might see churches rising in the villages, and
monasteries in the towns and cities, built in a new style; you
might see renewed services enrich the whole country, so that
every man of means counted that day lost which was not
marked by some great and glorious act.</p>

<h2 id="chap_2">THE HARRYING OF THE NORTH (1069).</h2>
</div>

<p class="center b2"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Simeon of Durham, <cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">Historia Regum</cite>, ed. Arnold,
vol. ii., p. 186. (Rolls Series.)</p>

<p>In the year 1069, the third year of his reign, king William
sent earl Robert Cumin against the Northumbrians in the
country north of the Tyne. But they had all united in one
determination not to submit to the lordship of an alien, and
resolved either to slay him or to fall, all of them together, by
the edge of the sword. On his approach, Aegelwin, bishop of
Durham, met and forewarned him to be on his guard against
ambushes; but he, thinking that none would be so bold, despised
the warning. Entering Durham with a large force of knights,
he allowed his men to act with hostility in all quarters, and
some peasants belonging to the church were killed. He was
received, however, by the bishop with all courtesy and honour.
But the Northumbrians, hastening all night to Durham, at
daybreak broke through the gates with great violence, and on
all sides surprised and slew the earl’s followers. The struggle
was fiercely waged; the knights were struck down in houses
and streets, and the combatants attacked the bishop’s house in
which the earl had been received, and since they could not
endure the darts of the defenders, burned down the house with
all who were therein. So great was the multitude of the slain,
that almost every part of the city was filled with blood; for
out of seven hundred men only one escaped. This slaughter
took place on the 28th of February, the fourth day of the
week.</p>

<p>In the same year, before the Nativity of St. Mary, the sons
of Sweyn, king of the Danes, Harold and Canute, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
uncle earl Osbarn, and Christian their bishop, and earl Turkill,
came from Denmark with 240 ships and landed at the mouth
of the river Humber. There they were joined by Edgar
Atheling, earl Waltheof and Marlesweyn and many others,
with a fleet which they had made ready. Earl Cospatric also
came with the whole strength of the Northumbrians, and all
with one accord joined forces against the Normans.... On
Saturday, the 19th September, the Normans who were holding
the castles (at York), fearing that the houses near the castles
would be of aid to the Danes in filling up the castle-moats,
began to set them on fire, and the flames, increasing, raged
throughout the whole city and destroyed with it the minster of
St. Peter. But divine vengeance was speedily and disastrously
wreaked upon them. For before the whole city was burned
down, the Danish fleet arrived on the second day of the week,
and the Danes on one side and the Northumbrians on the other
stormed and burst into the castles on the same day. More than
3000 Normans were slain, the lives of William Malet, who was
sheriff at that time, and of his wife and two children, and of
Gilbert de Ghent and a few others, being spared; the Danes
took ship with their innumerable forces, and the Northumbrians
returned to their homes.</p>

<p>But when king William heard the news, he at once gathered
an army and hastened to Northumberland with exasperation
at heart, and all the winter without ceasing laid waste the
country, cut men to pieces and committed many other deeds
of cruelty. Meanwhile he sent envoys to earl Osbarn the
Dane, and promised to give him secretly a large sum of money
and to allow his army freely to seize provisions along the sea-coasts,
on condition, however, that he should depart without
fighting at the close of winter. To these proposals he assented,
in his greed for gold and silver, with great dishonour to himself.</p>

<p>While the Normans were laying waste England, in Northumberland
and other districts in the preceding year, but in the
present and following year throughout the whole of England
and especially in Northumberland and the neighbouring provinces,
so great a famine prevailed that men, compelled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
hunger, ate human flesh, and horses, dogs and cats, and anything
whatsoever that is loathsome to experience; some sold
themselves into perpetual slavery, so long as they could somehow
support a miserable existence; others leaving the country
as exiles gave up the ghost in the middle of their journey. It
was horrible to behold human corpses rotting in the houses
and streets and highways, swarming with worms and reeking
with putrefaction. For there was none left to bury them, all
were cut off either by the sword or by famine, or for hunger
had abandoned their native land. And so for nine years the
land was destitute of tillers, and far and wide there extended
a barren waste. Between York and Durham never a town
was inhabited; there were only dens of wild beasts and robbers
to terrify the heart of the traveller.</p>

<h2 id="chap_3">THE RESISTANCE IN THE FENS (1070).</h2>
</div>

<p class="center b2"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;<cite>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</cite>, ed. Thorpe, vol. i., p. 345.
(Rolls Series.)</p>

<p>1070. In this year earl Waltheof made peace with the king;
and in Lent the king caused all the monasteries that were in
England to be plundered. Then in the same year came Sweyn,
king of Denmark, into the Humber, and the country folk came
to meet him and made peace with him, deeming that he should
overcome that country. Then came to Ely Christian, the
Danish bishop, and Osbarn the earl, and the Danish housecarles
with them; and the English folk from all the fenlands
came to them, deeming that they should win all the country.
Then the monks of Peterborough heard say that their own
men would plunder the monastery; that was Hereward and
his company. That was because they had heard say that the
king had given the abbacy to a French abbot named Turold
and that he was a very stern man, and was then come to
Stamford with all his Frenchmen. Now there was a church-warden
there named Yware, who took by night all that he
could, to wit, gospels, mass-mantles, cantor copes and vestments,
and such little things as he could, and went forthwith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
ere day, to the abbot Turold, and told him that he sought his
protection, and informed him how that the outlaws were coming
to Peterborough, and that he did all by the advice of the monks.
Then forthwith on the morrow came all the outlaws with many
ships, and would have entered the monastery; and the monks
withstood them, that they might not come in. Then they set
fire thereto and burned all the monks’ houses, and all the town
but one house. Then they came in through the fire at Bolhithe
gate, and the monks came to meet them, praying them peace.
But they recked nothing thereof, went into the monastery,
climbed up to the holy rood, and then took the crown from
our Lord’s head, all of beaten gold; then they took the foot-spur
that was underneath His foot, which was all of red gold.
They climbed up to the steeple, and brought down the crosier
that was there hidden; it was all of gold and of silver. They
took there two golden shrines, and nine of silver, and they took
fifteen great roods, both of gold and of silver. They took there
so much gold and silver, and so many treasures in money and
in raiment and in books, as no man may tell another, saying
that they did it out of reverence for the monastery. Then
went they to the ships, fared to Ely, and there put all the
treasures. The Danish men deemed that they would overcome
the Frenchmen; they then drove away all the monks, none
being left there but one monk, who was named Leofwine
Lange; he lay sick in the sick man’s ward.</p>

<p>Then came abbot Turold and eight score Frenchmen with
him, and all fully armed. When he came thither, he found all
burned within and without, save the church only. The outlaws
were then all afloat, knowing that he would come thither. This
was done on the fourth of June.</p>

<p>The two kings, William and Sweyn, were reconciled; and
the Danish men went forth out of Ely with all the aforesaid
treasures, and took the same with them. When they came
into the midst of the sea, there came a great storm and scattered
all the ships wherein the treasures were; some fared to
Norway, some to Ireland, some to Denmark, and all that came
thither were the crosier and some shrines and some roods and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
many of the other treasures; and they brought them to a king’s
town and put it all there in a church. Then afterwards, through
their heedlessness, and through their drunkenness, the church
was burned one night, and all that was therein. On this wise
was the monastery of Peterborough burned and plundered.
May God Almighty have compassion upon it of his great
lovingkindness. And on this wise came the abbot Turold to
Peterborough, and the monks came then again, and did Christ’s
service in their church, which had stood a full sennight without
any sort of rite. When bishop Aegelric heard tell thereof, he
excommunicated all the men who had done that evil deed.</p>

<h2 id="chap_4">THE DEPRESSION OF THE ENGLISH (1070).</h2>
</div>

<p class="center b2"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Florence of Worcester, <cite>Chronicon</cite>, ed. Thorpe,
vol. ii., pp. 4, 5.</p>

<p>In the season of Lent, by advice of William earl of Hereford
and certain others, king William ordered the monasteries of
the whole of England to be searched, and the money, which
the wealthier English had deposited therein on account of his
severity and devastation, to be taken from them and brought
to his treasury. On the octave of Easter (4 April) a great
council was held at Winchester, by the command and in the
presence of king William, with the consent of Pope Alexander,
whose authority was represented by his legates Ermenfred
bishop of Sion, and John and Peter, cardinal priests of the
apostolic see. In this council Stigand archbishop of Canterbury
was degraded on three grounds; to wit, because he
wrongfully held the bishopric of Winchester with the archbishopric;
and because, in the lifetime of archbishop Robert,
he had not only taken the archbishopric, but also for some time
in the celebration of mass had used his pall, which remained
at Canterbury, when he had been unjustly and forcibly expelled
from England; and because afterwards he received his pall
from Benedict, who had been excommunicated by the holy
church of Rome for having gained the apostolic see by bribery.
His brother Agelmar, bishop of East Anglia, was also degraded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Moreover several abbots were degraded there, the king being
bent on depriving as many of the English as possible of their
honours, and in their place he appointed persons of his own
race, to strengthen his hold on the kingdom which he had newly
acquired. Here also he deprived of their honours certain
bishops and abbots, whom neither synods nor secular laws
condemned on any obvious ground, and kept them in confinement
to the end of their lives, influenced simply, as we have
said, by distrust on account of his new kingdom.... After
this the king summoned from Normandy Lanfranc, abbot of
Caen, a Lombard by birth, a man of the widest range of
learning, and with expert knowledge alike of all liberal and
divine arts and of secular literature, and equally wise in counsel
and the administration of temporal affairs; on the Assumption
of St. Mary (15 August) he appointed him archbishop of the
church of Canterbury, and on the Nativity of St. John the
Baptist (24 June), being Sunday, caused him to be consecrated
archbishop at Canterbury. The ceremony was performed by
Giso bishop of Wells and Walter bishop of Hereford, who
had both been ordained at Rome by Pope Nicholas, when
Aldred archbishop of York received his pall, for they avoided
ordination by Stigand, who was then over the archbishopric
of Canterbury, knowing him to have received his pall uncanonically.
Bishop Herman also, who had transferred his
see from Sherborne to Salisbury, was present with certain
others at the consecration; whereafter Lanfranc consecrated
Thomas archbishop of York.</p>

conquered English who were left used to lie secretly in wait

and in remote places; and when, to avenge them, kings and
their ministers had for years with exquisite kinds of torture
cruelly entreated the English, and the latter none the less had
not altogether unlearned the habit, the following plan was
devised; the so-called “hundred,” in which a Norman was
found thus killed, when the compasser of his death was not
found and through flight could not be traced, was condemned
to pay a large sum of tested silver to the treasury, some
36<i>l.</i>, some 44<i>l.</i>, according to the size of the district and the

are not free to change their condition against the will of
their lords. On that account almost always when any one
is found so slain to-day, it is punished as murder, except in the
case of those whose servile condition, as we have said, is
apparent by obvious proofs.</p>

<p><i>D.</i>&mdash;I wonder that a prince of such unique excellence and
a man of so stern a mould should have shown such mercy
towards the English people, conquered and distrusted by him,
that he not only saved harmless the husbandmen by whom
agriculture might be practised, but left even to the nobles their
estates and wide possessions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p><i>M.</i>&mdash;These questions are not relevant to the matter in hand,
to which I am pledged; still I will gladly tell you what I have
heard hereon from the natives themselves. After the conquest
of the realm, after the just overthrow of the rebels,
when the king himself and the king’s barons traversed the
new country, a careful enquiry was made touching those
who fought against the king in battle and saved themselves
by flight. To all of these, and to the heirs also of those who
had fallen in battle, all hope of the lands and estates and
revenues which they had before possessed was denied; they
thought it much to enjoy the privilege of continuing to live
under their enemies. But as for those who were summoned
to the war and had not yet assembled, or had not been present
through domestic or any necessary occupations, when in the
course of time they had won the favour of their lords by
devoted service, they began to acquire possessions for themselves
only, without hope of passing them on to an heir,
at the will of their lords. But as time passed and they
became hateful to their lords and were everywhere driven
from their possessions, with none to restore what had been
taken away, a general complaint of the natives reached the
ear of the king, that if they were thus hated of all and
spoiled of their goods, they would be forced to cross to alien
peoples. Counsel was at length taken hereon, and it was
decreed that what their merits might earn from their lords by
a lawful covenant should be granted to them by inviolable
right, but that they should claim nothing for themselves by
right of heredity from the time of the conquest of the race.
The wise discretion of this provision is manifest, the more so
as they would thus be bound in every way in their own
interests to strive henceforth to win the favour of their lords
by devoted service. So, therefore, any member of the
conquered people who possesses estates or any such thing,
has acquired them not because they were thought to be due to
him by hereditary right, but because he has gotten them by
his merits or by covenant.</p>

<p>First, he desired that above all things one God should be
worshipped throughout the whole of his realm, one faith in
Christ kept always inviolate, and peace and security observed
between the English and the Normans.</p>

<p>We have decreed also that every freeman affirm by
covenant and oath that within and without England they will
be loyal to king William, and will keep his honour in all fealty
with him, and defend him against his enemies.</p>

<p>I will also that all men whom I have brought with me
or who have come after me be in my peace and quiet. And
if any one of them be killed, his lord shall have his murderer
within five days, if he can; and if not, he shall begin payment
to me of 46 marks of silver, so long as that lord’s possessions
last. And when his possessions fail, the whole hundred in
which that murder was committed shall pay the residue in
common.</p>

<p>And every Frenchman who in the time of king Edward,
my kinsman, was in England, sharing the customs of the
English which they call lot and scot,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> shall be paid for<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> according
to the law of the English. This decree was established in
the city of Gloucester.</p>

<p>We forbid also that any live cattle be sold or bought except
within cities, and this before three trusty witnesses, and that
none sell or buy anything old without surety and warrant.
And if any do otherwise he shall pay and pay to the full, and
shall afterwards pay a forfeiture.</p>

<p>It was also decreed there that if a Frenchman shall appeal
an Englishman of perjury or murder, theft, homicide, or
“ran,” which is the English term for manifest rape that
cannot be denied, the Englishman shall defend himself as
he shall prefer, either by the ordeal of iron or by battle. But
if the Englishman be sick, he shall find another to do it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
him. The one who shall be vanquished shall make amends in
40<i>s.</i> to the king. If an Englishman shall appeal a Frenchman
and refuse the proof of ordeal or battle, I will that the
Frenchman purge himself with an oath unbroken.</p>

<p>This also I command and will, that all men have and hold
the law of king Edward in lands and all other things, with
those additions which I have decreed for the benefit of the
English people.</p>

<p>Every man who will be holden for a freeman shall have
a surety, that the surety may hold and bring him to justice, if
he offend in aught. And if any such make default, his sureties
shall see to it that they pay simply what is charged against him,
and purge themselves of all collusion in his default. The
hundred court and the county court shall be convened, as our
ancestors decreed. And they who ought justly to come and
refuse to come, shall be summoned once; and if they refuse to
come the second time, one ox shall be taken, and they shall be
summoned a third time; and if they come not the third time,
another ox shall be taken; but if they come not a fourth time,
there shall be rendered from the goods of the man who shall
refuse to come what is charged against him, which is called
“ceapgeld”; and further a forfeiture to the king.</p>

<p>I forbid any to sell a man out of the country on pain of full
forfeiture to me.</p>

<p>I prohibit also that any man be killed or hanged for any
crime, but his eyes shall be plucked out or his members cut off.
And this command shall not be violated on pain of full forfeiture
to me.</p>

<p>William by the grace of God King of the English, to
R. Bainard and G. de Mandeville, and P. de Valoines, and
to the rest of my trusty men of Essex and of Hertfordshire
and of Middlesex, greeting. Know all of you and the rest of
my trusty men who remain in England, that in a common
council and by the advice of the archbishops and bishops, and
abbots, and of all the chief men of my kingdom, I have decided
that the episcopal laws, which up to my times in the kingdom
of the English have not been right or according to the precepts
of the holy canons, shall be amended. Wherefore I command,
and by royal authority decree, that no bishop or archdeacon
shall any longer hold in the hundred court pleas pertaining to
the episcopal laws, nor shall they bring before the judgment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>

whoever shall be summoned, according to the episcopal laws, in
any cause or for any fault, shall come to the place which the
bishop shall choose or name for this purpose, and shall there
answer in his cause or for his fault, and shall do right to God
and his bishop not according to the hundred court, but according
to the canons and the episcopal laws. But if any one,
puffed up by pride, shall scorn or refuse to come before the
judgment seat of the bishop, he shall be summoned once and a
second and a third time; and if he come not even then to make
amends, he shall be excommunicated; and, if it be needful to
give effect to this, the power and justice of the king or the
sheriff shall be called in. And he who is summoned before
the judgment seat of the bishop and refuses to come shall, for
such summons, make amends by the episcopal law. This also
I forbid and by my authority prohibit, that any sheriff, or
provost, or minister of the king, or any layman intermeddle
with the laws which pertain to the bishop, nor shall any layman
summon another man to judgment apart from the jurisdiction
of the bishop. But judgment shall be passed in no place
except within the episcopal see, or in such place as the bishop
shall fix upon for this purpose.</p>

<p>At the same time, to wit, when the king had returned from
Scotland, he built a castle in Durham, where the bishop and
his men might enjoy security from the (Scottish) invaders.
And since some of the Normans disbelieved that the blessed
Cuthbert was a saint or that his body was preserved there, at
the feast of All Saints, while the bishop was celebrating mass,
the king ordered two chaplains to enter the sanctuary, and
opening the tomb to examine both by sight and touch, whether
the holy body was laid there. For the king had already
resolved that, if it were not there, all the elders should be put
to the sword. So, while all were terror-stricken, the chaplains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
proceeded to execute his orders. Now at the time the weather
was severely cold, but the king meanwhile began to suffer from
an intolerable heat and to sweat profusely, and to be smitten
with an overpowering horror. He therefore sent quickly to
the chaplains and ordered them not to presume to touch the
tomb. And forthwith he took horse and galloped at full speed
until he reached the Tees, and thereafter held the saint in great
honour and confirmed for perpetual observance the laws and
customs of that church, to be held as fully as ever in past times.
And furthermore he gave and granted and by his charter

<p class="hang larger"><span class="smcap">General Council of the Realm of the English touching
the Right and Primacy of the Church of
Canterbury.</span></p>

<p>In the year 1072 after the incarnation of our Lord Jesus
Christ, the 11th year of the pontificate of the lord Pope
Alexander, and the sixth year of the reign of William, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
glorious king of the English and duke of the Normans, by
command of the same Pope Alexander and by assent of the
same king, in the presence of the king and of the bishops and
abbots, there was debated the cause of the primacy, which
Lanfranc, archbishop of Canterbury, claimed in right of his
church over the church of York, and of the ordination of
certain bishops, whereon there was no certainty to whom they
ought specially to pertain; and at length, by divers authorities
of divers writings, it was proved and shewn that the church of
York ought to be subject to Canterbury, and to obey the
rulings of the archbishop thereof, as primate of all Britain, in
all the things that pertain to the Christian religion. But the
metropolitan of Canterbury granted to the archbishop of York
and his successors that they should hold subject the bishop of
Durham, that is, of Lindisfarne, and all the districts from the
boundaries of the bishopric of Lichfield and the great river
Humber to the limits of the border of Scotland, and whatever
belongs of right to the diocese of the church of York on this
side of the aforesaid river; so that if the archbishop of Canterbury
would summon a council wheresoever he should deem
fit, the archbishop of York should attend the same at his
bidding, with all his suffragans, and obey his canonical rulings.
Lanfranc, archbishop of Canterbury, shewed also from the
ancient custom of his predecessors that the archbishop of York
ought to make profession to the archbishop of Canterbury, and
that too with an oath; but out of love for the king he released
Thomas, archbishop of York, from the oath and accepted a
written profession only, without prejudicing his successors, if
they should wish to demand from the successors of Thomas an
oath with the profession. If the archbishop of Canterbury
should die, the archbishop of York shall come to Canterbury,
and, with the other bishops of the church aforesaid, shall of
right consecrate him who shall be elected. And if the archbishop
of York should die, he who is chosen to succeed him,
after receiving from the king the gift of the archbishopric,
shall come to Canterbury or whither the archbishop of Canterbury
shall please, and shall receive canonical ordination from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
him. To this constitution assented the aforesaid King, and the
archbishops, Lanfranc of Canterbury, and Thomas of York,
and Hubert, subdeacon of the holy church of Rome and legate
of the aforesaid Pope Alexander, and the rest of the bishops
and abbots who were there. This cause was first debated in
the city of Winchester at the Easter festival, in the royal
chapel within the castle; and afterwards in the royal town
called Windsor, where also it was determined in the presence
of the King, the bishops and abbots of divers orders, who were
assembled at the Court on the feast of Whitsunday....</p>

<p>The profession of Thomas archbishop of York.&mdash;It becomes
all Christians to be subject to Christian laws, and not to contravene
for any reasons the things which have been soundly
instituted by the holy fathers. For hence come forth strivings,
dissensions, envyings, contentions and the like, which cast
down those who love them into eternal pains. And the more
exalted be a man’s rank, the more exact should be his obedience
to commands. Wherefore I, Thomas, now ordained metropolitan
of the church of York, having heard and understood
the argument, make absolute profession of canonical obedience
to you, Lanfranc, archbishop of Canterbury, and to your
successors; and whatsoever shall be justly and canonically
enjoined upon me by you or by them, I promise to observe.
I was doubtful upon this matter, while I was yet to be ordained
by you, and therefore it was I promised obedience unconditionally
to you, but to your successors conditionally.</p>

<p>Three poor monks, sent by divine inspiration from the
province of Mercia to the province of Northumberland, came
to York, and requested Hugh son of Baldric, then sheriff, to
find them a guide as far as the place called Monkchester, now
named Newcastle. They were brought thither and stayed
there for a time, but finding no trace of the ancient community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
of Christ’s servants there, they passed on to Jarrow,
where amid the ruins, that hardly indicated what they had
been of old, they found many monastic buildings with churches
half destroyed; here they were received by bishop Walcher
with the greatest kindness, and supplied by him with necessaries....
These three founded three monasteries in the
country of the Northumbrians; one at Durham, by the holy
and uncorrupt body of the father Cuthbert, in honour of St.
Mary the Virgin; another at York, in honour of the same
Mary, mother of God; ... and the third in the place ...
now called Whitby.... Indeed, after the savage devastation
of the heathen had with fire and sword reduced to ashes the
churches and monasteries, Christianity was almost extinct, and
scarcely any churches survived, and those covered with twigs
and thatch; and for two hundred years no monasteries had
been anywhere rebuilt. Faith in religion waxed so faint, and
religious services failed so utterly, that the name of monk was
unknown to the inhabitants, and they were struck with amazement
when they chanced to see any one of monkish garb and
life. But when these three men aforesaid began to dwell
among them, they too began to change their savage life and
manners for the better, and to help them in restoring the holy
places, and of themselves to restore and repair the half-ruined
churches, and even to build new churches in places where there
was none before. And many abandoned the secular life for
the warfare of monks, though few of these were natives of the
district, many more coming from remote parts of England,
drawn by reports to join them heart and soul.</p>

<p>Contrary to the command of king William, Roger earl of
Hereford, son of William, earl of the same county, gave his
sister in marriage to Ralph earl of the East Angles; they
celebrated the wedding with great magnificence amid a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
gathering of nobles in the county of Cambridge at a place
called Exning, and there, with the assent of almost all, entered
into a great conspiracy against king William; they also forced
earl Waltheof, whom they had secured by a stratagem, to
join their conspiracy. He, however, as soon as he could,
went to Lanfranc archbishop of Canterbury, and received
absolution from him, with the sacrament, for the crime of
which he was guilty against his will; and by his advice he
sought out king William, who was then in Normandy; and
disclosing to him the whole matter from beginning to end,
threw himself on his mercy. Meanwhile the aforesaid authors
of the conspiracy, in furtherance of their designs, repaired to
their castles, and began with their supporters to strain every
nerve to foment rebellion. But Wulstan bishop of Worcester,
with a large military force, prevented the earl of Hereford
from crossing the Severn and joining earl Ralph with his
army at the appointed place, and the bishop was joined by
Aegelwin abbot of Evesham, with his men, and summoned
to his aid Urse, the sheriff of Worcester, and Walter de Lacy,
with their forces, and a large company of the people. Earl
Ralph, on the other hand, camping near Cambridge, was met
by Odo, bishop of Bayeux, the king’s brother, and Geoffrey,
bishop of Coutances, with a large force of both English and
Normans ready for battle. Seeing that his intentions were
thwarted, and fearing the numbers of his opponents, he
fled secretly to Norwich, and entrusting the castle to his wife
and his knights, took ship and fled from England to Brittany;
he was pursued by his adversaries, who either slew or in
divers ways disabled all of his company whom they could
take. Then the leaders of the king’s men for a long time
invested the castle, until peace was granted by the king’s
permission and the countess and her men allowed to leave
England. After these events the king returned from Normandy
in autumn and put earl Roger in prison, and earl
Waltheof likewise, although he had sued for the king’s
mercy.... At Christmas following the king held his court
at Westminster, and of those who had risen against him he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
banished some from England, and mutilated others by putting
out their eyes or cutting off their hands. As for the earls
Waltheof and Roger, they were condemned by a judicial
sentence and committed to straiter imprisonment.</p>

<p>In the year 1075 earl Waltheof, by command of king
William, was led without the city of Winchester and there
unworthily and cruelly decapitated with an axe and buried
on the spot. But in course of time God so ordained it that
his body was disinterred and carried with great honour to
Croyland and honourably buried there in the church. While
he was still in possession of life, though placed in strait
confinement, he bewailed unceasingly and remorsefully all
that he had done amiss, and by watchings, prayers, fasts and
alms strove to make his peace with God; men tried to blot
out his memory on earth, but it is believed that in truth he
rejoices with the saints in heaven, on the faithful testimony of
the aforesaid archbishop Lanfranc, of pious memory, who
heard his confession and gave him absolution; for he asserted
that the earl was innocent of the charge imputed to him,
to wit, the aforesaid conspiracy, and that, like a true Christian,
he had regretted with tears of repentance whatsoever other
sins he had committed; and declared moreover that he himself
should be blessed, if, at the end of his own life, he should
obtain a like blessed repose.</p>

<p>A disgraceful dispute arose between the monks of Glastonbury
and abbot Thurstan, unworthy of the name of abbot,
a man of no tact, whom king William had preferred to the
said place from the monastery of Caen. Among his other
acts of stupidity he attempted to compel the monks to forsake
the Gregorian chant, which he despised, and to learn and sing
the chant of one William of Fécamp. When they took this
ill, for they had now grown old in the use of this chant and
in the rest of the ecclesiastical offices according to the practice
of the church of Rome, suddenly with a band of armed men he
rushed one day into the chapter-house, the monks suspecting
nothing, pursued them as they fled in terror into the church as
far as the altar, and there the armed men, piercing with darts
and arrows the crosses and images and shrines of the saints,
even slew one of the monks with a spear, as he clung to
the holy altar, while another fell at the altar’s edge, pierced
with arrows, and the rest, driven by necessity, defended
themselves with benches and candlesticks, and though sorely
wounded, drove the knights back beyond the choir; in the
result two of the monks were killed and fourteen wounded,
and some of the knights also were wounded. The matter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
brought to judgment, and since the greatest blame rested
on the abbot, the king removed him and sent him back to
his monastery in Normandy. Many of the monks, however,
were dispersed by the king’s command among bishoprics and
abbeys, to be kept under guard. After the king’s death, the
same abbot again purchased his abbey from the king’s son
king William for 500<i>l.</i> of silver, and after wandering for
some years among the possessions of the church, wretchedly
ended his life far from the monastery itself, as he justly
deserved.</p>

rebels by terrible examples, he decreed that the subject race
should submit to a written law and a written code, to prevent
thereafter the existence of an easy means of error. The
English laws, therefore, were laid before him, according to
their threefold diversity, to wit, Mercian law, Dane law, and
West Saxon law; some laws he denounced, others he approved,
and added thereto the foreign laws of Neustria which he thought
most effectual for the keeping of the peace of the realm.
Finally, that nothing might be thought lacking, he brought
the whole of his far-seeing measures to completion by despatching
from his side his wisest men in circuit throughout
the realm. The latter made a careful survey of the whole land,
in woods and pastures and meadows, and arable lands also,
which was reduced to a common phraseology and compiled
into a book, that every man might be content with his own
right and not encroach with impunity on that of another. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>

name being set down at the head, and thereafter the names of
the other lords appearing in turn according to the dignity of
their rank, those, namely, who hold of the king in chief. Each
name thus in the list is numbered in order, so that the section
concerning them can easily be found in its place below in the
book. This book is called “Domesday” by the natives, that
is “the day of judgment” by a metaphor; for just as the award
of that last stern and terrible trial cannot be evaded by any
subtlety of pleading, so when a dispute has arisen in the realm
touching the things there noted, once the book is referred to,
its award cannot be derided or with impunity defied. Therefore
we have named it the book of dooms, not because it makes
awards on any matter in dispute, but because, like the last
judgment, it allows no sort of evasion.</p>

<p>Then at Midwinter was the king at Gloucester with his
witan and there held his court five days, and thereafter the
archbishop and clergy had a synod three days.... After
this the king had a great council and very deep speech with
his witan touching this land, how it was peopled or with how
many men. Then he sent his men over all England into every
shire, and caused to be learned how many hundred hides were
in the shire, or what land the king himself had and what cattle
on that land, or what manner of dues he ought to have for
twelve months from the shire. Also he caused to be written
how much land his archbishops had, and his bishops and his
abbots and his earls, and, though I take long to tell it, what

<p>In the city of Shrewsbury in the time of King Edward there
were 252 houses, and as many burgesses in the same houses,
rendering yearly 7<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> of rent. King Edward had there
the customs below written.</p>

<p>If any man wittingly broke the peace of the King given with
his own hand, he was made an outlaw. And he who broke the
peace of the King given by the sheriff made amends in 100<i>s.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
and gave as much as he who committed “Forestel”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> or
“Heinfare.”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> These three forfeitures King Edward had in
demesne in the whole of England beyond the farms.</p>

<p>When the King lay in this city, twelve men of the city of the
better sort served him, keeping watch over him. And when
he went hunting there, burgesses of the better sort, having
horses, guarded him with arms in like manner. And for
beating the woods the sheriff sent thirty-six footmen, so long
as the King were there. And for the park of Marsetelie he
found thirty-six men by custom for eight days.</p>

<p>When the sheriff wished to go into Wales, he who went not
after being summoned by him gave 40<i>s.</i> of forfeiture.</p>

<p>A woman in any wise taking a husband gave to the King
20<i>s.</i> if she was a widow, 10<i>s.</i> if she was a maid, in what wise
soever she should take a man.</p>

<p>Any burgess soever whose house should be burned by any
chance or hap or by negligence, gave to the King 40<i>s.</i> for
forfeiture, and to his two nearer neighbours 2<i>s.</i> to each.</p>

<p>When a burgess who was on the King’s demesne died, the
King had 10<i>s.</i> by way of relief.</p>

<p>If any burgess broke the term which the sheriff imposed upon
him, he made amends in 10<i>s.</i> He who shed blood made amends
in 40<i>s.</i></p>

<p>When the King went from the city, the sheriff sent to him
twenty-four horses as far as Leintwardine, and the King
brought them as far as the first manor-house of Staffordshire.</p>

<p>The King had there three moneyers, who, after they had
bought their money-dies, on the fifteenth day gave each to the
King 20<i>s.</i> like other moneyers of the country. And this was
done at the change of coinage.</p>

<p>In all, this city rendered 30<i>l.</i> a year. The King had two
parts, and the sheriff a third.</p>

<p>In the year preceding this survey it rendered 40<i>l.</i> to Earl Roger.</p>

<p>Of these, St. Almund had 2 hides, St. Juliana half a hide,

<p>The English burgesses of Shrewsbury say that it is a great
burden to them that they render the whole geld as it was
rendered in the time of King Edward, although the earl’s castle
has occupied 51 dwellings, and 50 other dwellings are waste,
and 43 French burgesses hold dwellings which gelded in the
time of King Edward, and the Earl has himself given to the
abbey which he is building there 39 burgesses, who in like
manner formerly gelded with the others. In all there are
200 dwellings less seven, which pay no geld.</p>

<p>In this year the king bare his crown and held his court at
Winchester at Easter; and so he fared that he was at Westminster
on Whitsunday and there dubbed his son Henry a
knight. Thereafter he fared so that he came at Lammas to
Salisbury, and there his witan came to him, and all the landholders
who were of account all over England, what man’s
men soever they were; and they all bowed down to him and
became his men, and swore to him oaths of fealty, that they

<p>Be it known that he who should do his homage, in view of
the reverence which he owes his lord, should wait upon his
lord wherever he may be found in the realm or elsewhere, if
he can be conveniently waited upon; and the lord is not bound
to seek out his tenant. And he should do homage to him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
this wise: the tenant should first put both his hands between
both hands of his lord, which signifies on the part of the lord
protection, defence and warranty, and on the part of the tenant
reverence and subjection, and he should say these words: “I
become your man for the tenement which I hold of you and
ought to hold, and I will bear faith to you of life and limb and
earthly honour, and I will bear faith to you against all men,
saving the faith due to the lord the King and his heirs.” And
straightway afterwards he shall make the oath of fealty to his
lord in this wise: “This you hear, my lord N., that I will bear
faith to you of life and limb, body and chattels and earthly
honour, so help me God and these holy relics.” And some
add in the oath, and well so, that faithfully and without diminution,
contradiction or hindrance or unjust delay, the tenant
will do his service to his lord and his heirs at the stated terms.</p>

<p>And homage ought not to be done in private, but in a public
and common place before many persons in the county, hundred
or court, so that if by chance the tenant through malice should
wish to deny the homage, the lord could the more easily have
proof of homage done and service acknowledged.</p>

archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, barons and all my trusty
men, French and English, present and to come, that when
I came to England and landed with an army within the bounds
of Hastings against my enemies who were striving unjustly to
deprive me of the kingdom of England, upon the edge of battle,
when I was already armed, I made a vow before my barons
and knights, with the approval of them all and to strengthen
their hearts, that I would build a church to the honour of God
for the common salvation, if by God’s grace I should avail to
gain the victory. And since we obtained the victory, I have
fulfilled my vow and in honour of the Holy Trinity and St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Martin the Confessor of Christ I have built a church for the
salvation of my soul and the souls of my predecessor, king
Edward, and my wife, queen Matilda, and my successors in
the kingdom, and for the salvation of all by whose labour and
aid I obtained the kingdom, and specially of those who fell in
the battle itself. And because God gave me victory in battle
in this place where the church has been so built, in memory
of the victory I have determined that the place itself shall be
called Battle.</p>

<p>Therefore to this church of St. Martin, Battle, first of all by
royal authority I grant the dignity that it have its court in all
matters, and the royal liberty and custom of treating of its
own business and affairs, and justice to be holden by itself,
and that it be free and quit for ever from all subjection to
bishops and all domination of any persons, as is the church
of Christ at Canterbury. And if any robber or homicide or
any criminal, fleeing for fear of death, shall come to this church,
he shall suffer no manner of hurt, but shall be sent away wholly
free. And the abbot of the church may everywhere set free
from hanging a robber or thief, if he come upon such. I grant
also to the same church the lowey<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> adjacent on every side free
and quit of all geld and scot, hidage and danegelds, and bridge-works

armies, and all aids, and pleas and plaints and shires and
hundreds,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> with sac and soc,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and tol<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> and theam,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> and infangenetheof<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>

also of all custom of earthly service and of all exactions of
bishops.</p>

<p>Further, I give to the church of St. Martin, Battle, the royal
manor called Wye, with all its appurtenances from my crown
demesne, with all liberties and royal customs, as free and quit
as ever I have held it, or could grant it as king, to wit, from
all geld and scot and hidages and danegelds and bridge-works
and castle-works and enclosures of parks, and armies, and all
aids and pleas and shires and hundreds, with sac and soc and
tol and theam and infangenetheof and warpeni and lastages
and hamsocne and forestall and blodwite and cildwite and
larceny, if the same arise. Likewise I give 2<i>d.</i> from all forfeitures
and pleas of all hundreds that pertain to the summons
of Wye. In Denge marsh also, which is a member of Wye,
I grant to the same church all maritime customs which I have
had there, with all wreck. And if any fish called “craspeis”
(whale) come there, it shall belong wholly to the abbot and
monks, but if it come ashore between the bounds of Blachewase
and Horsemede and Bradelle as far as Withiburne, the church
shall have two parts of the fish and the tongue, as I have
always had.</p>

<p>I give also to the same church these manors, Alciston,
Limpsfield, Hoo, Crowmarsh and Brightwalton, with all their
appurtenances, free and quit with the aforesaid liberties and
royal customs. If murder-fine be due in the lowey or in the
manors of the church, or if treasure be found, both shall belong
to the abbot and monks. The church shall have its own warren
in the lowey and in all its manors. I give also to the same
church of St. Martin the church of Reading, and the church
of Cullompton, and the church of St. Olave, Exeter, with the
lands and tithes and all things pertaining thereto. And if any
of my barons or men give anything of their own to the same
church in almoin, I grant to them therein the same liberties
which I have granted in my own gifts to the same church,
and by this writing by royal authority, as aforesaid, I confirm
the same.</p>

</div>

<p class="center b2"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;<cite>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</cite>, ed. Thorpe, vol. i., p. 353.

<p>After the birth-tide of our Lord Jesus Christ one thousand
and seven and eighty winters, in the one and twentieth year
that William ruled and governed England, as God permitted
him, there befel a most heavy and most pestilent year in this
land. Such a sickness came on men that wellnigh every other
man was in the worst evil, that is with the fever, and that so
sorely that many men died of the evil. Afterwards there came,
through the great tempests which befel, as we told before, a
very great famine over all England, so that many hundred
men woefully met their death through that famine. Ah! how
woeful and how rueful a time was then, when the wretched
men lay driven full nigh to death, and thereafter came the
sharp hunger and destroyed them withal. Whom can such
times not touch? and who is so hard of heart that he cannot
weep for such misfortune? But such things befal for a folk’s
sins, because they will not love God and righteousness; so it
was in those days that little righteousness was in this land
with any man, but with the monks only, where they fared
well. The king and the chief men loved much and overmuch
the getting of gold and of silver, and cared not how sinfully it
were gotten, if only it came to them. The king granted his
land for as dear a rent as he could; then came some other and
offered more than the other gave before, and the king let it to
the man who offered him more; then came a third and offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
yet more, and the king let it to the man who offered him most
of all; and he cared not how sinfully the reeves got it from
poor men, nor how many unlawful things they did, but the
more men spake of right laws, the more unlawful things they
did. They gathered unjust tolls, and many other unjust things
they did, which are hard to number.</p>

<p>And in the same year before harvest the holy minster of
St. Paul, the bishop’s see in London, was burned, and many
other minsters, and the greatest and fairest part of all that
borough. So also, at the same time, wellnigh every chief
town in all England was burned. Ah! a rueful and sorrowful
time was that year, which brought forth so many misfortunes.
Also in the same year before the Assumption of St. Mary
(15 August) king William went from Normandy into France
with a host and made war upon his own lord, Philip the king,
and slew a great part of his men, and burned the borough of
Mantes and all the holy monasteries that were within the
borough; and two holy men, who served God dwelling in
a hermitage, were there burned. This so done, king William
turned again to Normandy. A rueful thing he did, and a more
rueful thing befel him. How more rueful? He fell sick and
was sorely stricken. What can I say? Sharp death that passes
by neither mighty men nor humble, took him. He died in
Normandy on the day next after the Nativity of St. Mary
(9 September), and he was buried at Caen in the monastery
of St. Stephen, which he had formerly built and afterwards
richly endowed. Ah! how false and how unstable is the wealth
of this world. He who was before a mighty king and lord of
many a land had then of all his land but a seven foot strip, and
he who was once decked with gold and with gems lay then
covered over with mould....</p>

<p>If any one will know what sort of a man he was, or what
worship he had, or of how many lands he was lord, then will
we write of him as we understood him, who looked upon him
and at another time dwelt in his court. King William, of
whom we speak, was a very wise man and very mighty, and
worthier and stronger than were any of his predecessors. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
was gentle to the good men who loved God, and beyond all
measure severe to the men who withstood his will. On the
same spot where God granted to him that he should conquer
England, he built a noble monastery and set monks there and
well endowed it. In his days was built the noble monastery
at Canterbury, and also full many others over all England.
Yea! this land was filled with monks, and they lived their life
after the rule of St. Benedict, and Christianity was such in his
day that every man that would followed what belonged to his
degree. Also he was full worshipful; thrice he bare his crown
each year as oft as he was in England; at Easter he bare it in
Winchester, on Whitsunday at Westminster, at Midwinter in
Gloucester. And then there were with him all the mighty
men over all England, archbishops and bishops, abbots and
earls, thegns and knights. So also was he a full stern and cruel
man, so that none durst do anything against his will. He had
earls in his bonds who had done against his will; bishops he
put away from their bishoprics, and abbots from their abbeys,
and thegns he put in prison, and at last he spared not his own
brother Odo. He was a very great bishop in Normandy, at
Bayeux was his bishop’s see, and he was the foremost man beside
the king. He had an earldom in England, and when the king
was in Normandy, then was he the mightiest in this land; and
him he put in prison.</p>

<p>Among other things is not to be forgotten the good peace
that he made in this land, so that a man who himself were
aught might fare unhurt throughout his realm with his bosom
full of gold. And no man durst slay another man, how much
evil soever he had done to the other.... He reigned over
England and by his wisdom so well surveyed it, that there
was not a hide of land in England that he knew not who had
it, or what it was worth, and afterwards set it in his book.
Wales was in his lordship, and he wrought castles therein and
ruled over that race of men withal. So also he subdued Scotland
to him by his great strength. The land of Normandy
was his by heritage, and he ruled over the county called
Maine, and if he might have lived yet two years more, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
would have won Ireland by his valour, and without any
weapons.</p>

<p>Truly in his time men had much hardship and full many
troubles. He caused castles to be built and poor men to be
sore oppressed. The king was so very stern and took from
his subjects many a mark of gold and more hundred pounds
of silver, which he took by weight and with much unright
from his people for little need. He was fallen upon covetousness
and greed he loved withal. He planted a great deer forest
and laid down laws for the same that whosoever slew hart or
hind should be blinded. He forbade that the harts and also
the boars be slain; so much he loved the high deer, as he had
been their father. Also he ordained for the hares, that they
should go free. His mighty men grieved and the poor men
murmured thereat, but he was so hard that he cared not for
the hatred of them all, and they must follow the king’s will
withal, if they would live or hold land or chattels, or even
have his peace. Ah! that any man should be so haughty and
lift himself up and count himself above all men. May God
Almighty shew his soul lovingkindness and forgive him his
sins. These things we have written of him, both the good
and the evil, that good men may follow after the good and
altogether eschew the evil, and go in the way that leads us to
the kingdom of heaven.</p>

transgressors in forests, whether pecuniary or corporal, are
kept apart from the other judgments of the realm and reserved
for the decision of the king alone or of one of his intimate
ministers specially deputed hereto. It subsists by its own
laws, which are said to rest not upon the common law of the
realm but on the personal will of the kings, so that anything
that is done by forest-law is said to be not just absolutely, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
just according to forest-law. The forests, moreover, are the
kings’ sanctuaries and their highest delight, for to them they
come to hunt when they lay aside the cares of state for a while,
that they may be refreshed by a brief rest. There they put off
at once their burdens and the inevitable turmoil of the court,
and breathe for a space the blessed air of natural freedom;

<h2 id="chap_24">THE TRAINING AND TEMPERAMENT OF WILLIAM RUFUS.</h2>

ed. Stubbs, vol. ii., pp. 359, 366, 368. (Rolls Series.)</p>

<p>William the son of William was born in Normandy many
years before his father came to England. He was brought up
by his parents with great care, and, since he was endowed by
nature with a mind fertile in great schemes, he climbed to the
utmost summit of honour. He would have been without doubt
a prince incomparable in our time, had not his father’s greatness
eclipsed him, and had not destiny cut him off ere his
prime, before riper years might correct faults which sprang
from the licence of power and the rashness of youth. After
his childhood, his early years were spent in military pursuits,
in riding, in throwing the spear, in contending with his elders
in service, and with those of his own age in duty. He counted
it a reproach to his courage if another took arms before him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
warfare, or if he were not the first to challenge the enemy, or,
if challenged, to overthrow him. Loyal to his father in all
things, he fought before his eyes in battle and stayed at his
side in time of peace. With a gradually widening ambition,
he was now eager to succeed to the throne, especially after the
renunciation of his elder brother, though he was not without
suspicion of his untried younger brother. So when his father,
lying in his last illness, adopted him as his successor, he went
in haste to take possession of the realm, before the king had
breathed his last; and soon after was gladly received by the
people and secured the keys of the treasury, by means whereof
he subjected the whole of England to his will. Archbishop
Lanfranc, the greatest power of the state, declared in favour
of him, because he had educated him and made him a
knight....</p>

<p>He was endowed with a high generosity of soul, which in the
course of time was obscured by an excessive harshness, and
vices crept into his heart in place of virtues so insensibly as to
escape observation. For a long time men were in doubt
whither his nature would carry and incline him. At first,
during the life of archbishop Lanfranc, he shrank from any
kind of crime, so that men hoped he would prove an unexampled
mirror of royalty; and after Lanfranc’s death, he
wavered for a time, poised between good and evil courses; but
at length, in his last years, desire for good froze in him, and a
crop of ills grew and ripened; his generosity became prodigality,
his large-heartedness became pride, his severity became
brutality.... Abroad and at gatherings of men he stood high
and proud of aspect, fixing a threatening eye on bystanders,
and repelling those who spoke with him with an assumed
severity and fierce tones; as may be guessed, a fear of inadequate
supplies and of others’ treachery made him unduly
rapacious and stern. In private and at table with friends he
was altogether easy and genial and full of jest. He was the
wittiest of commentators on his own misdeeds, and strove to
rid himself of the odium by an epigram....</p>

<p>He had no conception of making a bargain or valuing wares,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
and a trader could unload his goods on him at any price, and a
soldier demand any pay. He wished the price of his clothes
to be extravagant, and was disdainful of cheapness. One
morning, when he was putting on new boots, he asked the
chamberlain how much they had cost, and when he replied
“Three shillings,” he shouted indignantly and angrily,
“Bastard! how long has the king worn boots at that mean
price? go and fetch me a pair worth a mark of silver.” He
went, and bringing a much cheaper pair falsely said that they
had cost as much as the king had commanded. “Ah!” said
the king, “those are fit for the royal majesty.” So the
chamberlain used afterwards to charge him what he pleased
for his clothes, and bought many a thing for his own benefit.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_25">THE REBELLION OF BISHOP ODO (1088).</h2>
</div>

<p class="center b2"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;William of Malmesbury, <cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">De gestis regum Anglorum</cite>,
ed. Stubbs, vol. ii., p. 360. (Rolls Series.)</p>

<p>At the beginning of Spring the first struggle was against
Odo, the king’s uncle, bishop of Bayeux. For when, as I
have related, on his release from prison, he had established
his nephew Robert in the duchy of Normandy, he came to
England and received from the king the earldom of Kent; but
seeing how all things in England were administered not according
to his will as before (for the control of public affairs had
been entrusted to William bishop of Durham), he was smitten
with jealousy, and himself deserting the king, he intrigued also
with many others, urging that Robert was of an easier disposition
and had tempered his youthful excesses with great
hardships, and therefore deserved the realm; William, on the
other hand, carefully brought up as he was, and overbearing
and brutal, as his face itself proved, would set at nought all
right and justice; soon they would lose the honours so strenuously
won; they would have gained nothing by the father’s
death, if the son slew those whom the father had imprisoned.
These complaints were first made in secret by him and Roger
of Montgomery, and by Geoffrey bishop of Coutances, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
his nephew Robert earl of Northumberland; afterwards they
interchanged letters and plotted openly. Even William bishop
of Durham, the king’s confidant, had joined in their treason; a
source of grave concern to the king, it is said, because he at
once lost a friend and was deprived of supplies from the distant
provinces. Thereupon Odo conveyed booty of all kinds to
Rochester, laying waste the king’s demesnes in Kent, and
especially the lands of the archbishop, against whom he
breathed an undying hatred, since, as he alleged, it was by the
archbishop’s advice that his brother had cast him into prison.
This charge was true enough, for when the elder William had
complained to Lanfranc of his brother’s desertion, Lanfranc
said, “Seize and imprison him!” “What!” he replied, “he is
a clerk.” To which the archbishop rejoined, with playful wit,
“weighing the objection with nice antitheses,” as Persius
remarks, “You will not be laying hands on the bishop of
Bayeux, you will be committing to prison the earl of Kent.”
Bishop Geoffrey, with his nephew, ravaging Bath and Berkeley
and part of Wiltshire, gathered his forces at Bristol. Roger
of Montgomery, sending his troops with Welshmen from
Shrewsbury plundered Worcestershire, and was now threatening
Worcester, when the king’s knights who guarded the city,
relying on the blessing of bishop Wulstan, to whom the keeping
of the castle had been committed, few though they were, put
to flight their numerous opponents, wounding and killing many,
and taking some prisoners. At the same time Roger Bigod at
Norwich and Hugh Grantmesnil at Leicester were ravaging
each his own country. In vain, however, did the whole
strength of rebellion rage against the king, who lacked neither
wisdom nor good fortune. Seeing well-nigh all the Normans
leagued together in one wild revolt, he summoned by letters of
request such trusty and stout Englishmen as were still left, and
complaining to them of his wrongs, bound them in fealty to
him by promises of good laws, relief from taxation and the
right of free chase. With equal skill he won over Roger of
Montgomery, who, concealing his treachery, was riding with
him. Taking him aside, he heaped reproaches upon him, saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
he would gladly abdicate, if Roger and the others whom
his father had left as his guardians thought fit; he failed to
understand why they were so outrageous; if they wanted
money, they might have what they chose; if an increase of
their inheritances, be it so; indeed they might have what they
wished. Only they must take care not to imperil the validity
of his father’s decision; for if they chose to defy it in his case,
they must beware of the precedent in their own case; for he
who had made him king had made them earls. Stirred by
these words and promises, the chief rebel, after Odo, was the
first to fall away. So the king, marching at once against the
traitors, stormed his uncle’s castles of Tonbridge and Pevensey,
captured Odo in the latter and forced him to swear that he
would leave England and give up Rochester. To accomplish
the same he sent him in advance with a loyal guard, himself
following slowly. Now at that time there was at Rochester
almost the whole of the younger nobility of England and
Normandy; three sons of earl Roger, the younger Eustace of
Boulogne and many others whom I need not specify. The
royal guards of the bishop were few and unarmed, for who
would suspect treachery in his company? They leapt down
before the walls, calling to the townsmen to open the gates;
it was the will of the bishop, there with them; it was the command
of the king, though absent. But they, seeing that the
bishop’s aspect discountenanced the speaker’s words, suddenly
opened the gates, rushed out, took horse and carried them all
away bound, with the bishop. Reports of the event speedily
reached the king, whose reverse stiffened his purpose; smothering
his wrath, he summoned his Englishmen, and bade them
gather all their countrymen for the siege, unless they would
earn the name of “nithing” (that is, worthless). The English,
who reckoned nothing more disgraceful than to be branded
with this dishonourable term, flocked in multitudes to the king
and made his host invincible. The townsmen could no longer
avoid submission, realising that a band of men, however noble,
however compact, could avail nothing against the king of
England. Odo, taken a second time, abjured England for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
ever; the bishop of Durham of his own will crossed the sea,
the king, out of regard for past friendship, suffering him to
escape harmless; while the rest were all admitted to fealty.</p>

<p class="center b2"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Simeon of Durham, <cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">De injusta vexatione Willelmi episcopi
primi</cite>, ed. Arnold, vol. i., p. 171. (Rolls Series.)</p>

<p>King William the younger disseised<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> the bishop of Durham
of his own lands and the lands of his church on 4 March, and
caused his men and all his goods to be taken, wherever he
could; he also ordered the bishop to be taken, and laid many
snares for him; but by God’s will the bishop escaped them,
and coming to Durham, sent his messenger to the king with
the following letter on the very day on which he entered
Durham:</p>

<p>“To his lord, William, king of the English, William bishop
of Durham, greeting and loyal service. Know, my lord, that
your men of York and Lincoln detain my men under arrest,
and have seized my lands, and would have taken me also, if
they could; and they say that they have done all these things
at your command. I request you, therefore, as my lord, to
cause my men and my lands to be restored with my chattels
to me, as your liege man, whom you have never appealed<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
of any crime, and who has never stood on his defence before
you. If you will appeal me hereafter of any crime, I am ready
to justify myself before you in your court at a convenient term,
on receipt of a safe conduct. But I earnestly beg you not to
treat me so basely and dishonourably, nor to disseise me unjustly,
upon the advice of my enemies. For it is not every
man who may judge bishops, and for my part, saving always
my order, I undertake to offer you complete satisfaction; and
if at the present you desire to have my service or the service
of my men, I offer you the same at your pleasure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>The king, however, on receiving and hearing the bishop’s
letter, gave the bishop’s lands to his barons before the eyes
of the messenger whom the bishop had sent, and again commanded
the bishop to come to him, on the condition that if he
should refuse to abide by the king’s will, he might return safely
to Durham. But when the bishop, on hearing this answer,
was ready to go to the king, he sent first to the sheriff of York,
asking for a safe journey to the king’s presence. But Ralph
Paynel, who was then sheriff, refused a conduct not only to
the bishop but to all his messengers and men desiring to go
to the king; he even seized the bishop’s monk who was returning
from the king, and killed his horse, permitting him,
however, to go on his way thereafter. Furthermore, on the
king’s behalf, he commanded all the king’s men to do harm
to the bishop wheresoever and howsoever they could. So, when
the bishop was thus prevented from seeking the king either in
person or by messenger, and had endured the destruction and
devastation of his lands without any retaliation for seven weeks
and more, the king at length sent to him the abbot of St. Augustine’s,
commanding him, as he had before commanded, to
come to his court with the abbot. The bishop, however, fearing
the snares of his enemies and the king’s anger, answered that
he could not come without a safe conduct, and sent his messengers
in the abbot’s company with a letter to the king to
that effect....</p>

<p>The king, on seeing this letter, sent the bishop a safe conduct,
and assured him by letter that no hurt should be done him
by the king himself or his men, until he should have left the
king and reached Durham once more. The bishop, therefore,
went to the king, and prayed to be put on his trial as a bishop.
The king replied that he would consent to a trial only if the
bishop would plead in a lay court and forego the safe conduct
granted to him; if he should refuse so to plead, he must go
back to Durham. The bishop then asked the archbishop of
York and the bishops there present to advise him thereon.
But the bishops replied that the king had forbidden them to
advise him. Then the bishop pressed his archbishop to advise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
him, as a matter of right, due to his church and to himself.
The archbishop therefore made request to the king thereon, but
reported to the bishop that it was impossible. So the bishop himself
prayed the king to allow him the advice of his archbishop
and primate and the bishops, his peers, but the king summarily
refused. The bishop then offered to purge himself of the
charge of treason and disloyalty; the king, however, rejected
the offer, and the bishop returned to Durham. Meanwhile the
king had seized there more than 700 men and considerable
booty.</p>

<p>Again therefore the bishop sent a letter to the king by one
of his monks.... The king replied by seizing and imprisoning
the monk who brought it, and sent his army against the
bishop; and after the troops had laid waste the bishop’s lands
with fire and plunder, the barons opened negotiations with the
bishop, and both parties agreed to a solemn covenant....</p>

<p>On the strength of this, the plea was respited on both sides
until 10 November, and on that day the bishop came to Salisbury....
The bishop rose in court and prayed the king to
restore to him his bishopric, which he had long ago taken from
him without a judgment. The king said nothing, but Lanfranc
replied, “The king has taken away no part of your bishopric, nor
has any other man at his command, nor have you seen his writ
disseising you or commanding you to be disseised of your
bishopric.” The bishop rejoined, “No, but I have seen Ralph
Paynel, and I see him here; and he, by the king’s command,
has disseised me of the whole of my bishopric in Yorkshire....”
Lanfranc replied, “The king summons you to make your
defence to him, and his barons have brought you here to that
end; yet you ask that he first make his defence to you! First
defend yourself, and then ask what you are now asking.” The
bishop said in answer, “My lord archbishop, do you say that
by way of advice or by way of judgment?” “By way of
advice, of course,” said he, “but if the king will listen to me,
he will make a judgment of it soon enough.” At these words
of Lanfranc, the primate of all England, the lay barons were
aroused and cried out against the bishop, asserting that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
contrary to right that the king should answer the bishop before
the latter had justified himself to the king.</p>

<p>The lay barons gave utterance to this and many other statements,
with much repetition, but when silence was restored,
the bishop said, “My lords, barons and laymen, allow me, I
beg you, to say what I have to say to the king, and to make
my answer to the archbishops and bishops. I have nothing
to say to you, and since I have not come here to receive your
judgment, I reject it altogether; even if it had pleased our lord
the king and the archbishops and bishops that you should
meddle with this matter, it would not have befitted me to
submit to such an indignity.” The king then said, “I trusted
that the bishop would first answer me touching the charges
I make against him; I am astonished that he asks for anything
else.” Thereupon earl Alan and earl Roger said, “We have
brought the bishop to justify himself to the king.” To which
the bishop replied, “Robbed as I am, I am ready to answer,
if I be tried canonically, for I will not go one step beyond the
law of my order in this suit.” Roger Bigot then said to the
king, “You should tell the bishop whereof you appeal him, and
afterward, if he refuse to answer to us, cause him to be judged
touching his answer; if not, do thereon what your barons
advise you.” The bishop rejoined, “I have just said, and I
say again, that I reject altogether the judgment of laymen,
and anything that contravenes the canons. I accept no
accusation, unless I be first invested with my bishopric, or
unless it be awarded by a canonical judgment that I must be
charged and make answer and be judged before such investiture.”
Then Hugh de Beaumont rose by the king’s command
and said to the bishop, “The king appeals you of this, that
when he learned that his enemies were rising against him, and
his men, to wit, the bishop of Bayeux and earl Roger and many
others, were attempting to deprive him of his realm and crown,
and he, by your advice, rode against them, he summoned you,
in my presence, to ride with him, and you answered that you
would willingly go with the seven knights whom you had there,
and would send to your castle for more with all speed; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
afterwards you fled from his court without his licence, taking
with you some men of his household, and so failed him in his
necessity. And now it is his will that you do thereon to him
what his court shall award, and if need be, he will appeal you
afterwards of more offences.” The bishop, however, replied
to him, “Hugh, say what you like, but you I will not answer
today....” Hugh de Beaumont rejoined, “If I today fail
to judge you and your order, you or your order shall never
judge me again....” The bishop went out with his men,
and on his return, Thomas, archbishop of York, said to him,
“My lord bishop, our lord archbishop and the king’s court
awards that you do right to the king before he reinvest you
with your fee....” The bishop said, “The judgment here
given I reject, because it contravenes the canons and our law
... and since I am conscious that through the king’s hatred
you are all against me, I appeal to the apostolic see, the holy
church of Rome, to St. Peter and his vicar....” Thereupon
archbishop Lanfranc replied, “We are not judging you touching
your bishopric, but touching your fee, and in the same way
we judged the bishop of Bayeux before this king’s father,
touching his fee; in that suit the king did not summon him
as a bishop, but as his brother and as an earl.” The bishop
answered, “My lord archbishop, I have not said a word today
about a fee, nor have I said that I had a fee; I complained,
and I complain still, of the disseisin of my bishopric.” The
archbishop rejoined, “I may not have heard you speak of a
fee, but I know you had a great fee, and we have judged you
thereon.” The bishop replied, “My lord archbishop, I gather
now that you have ignored all that I have said, and judge me
out of your own knowledge; but though by God’s grace you
are exceeding wise and of great reputation, I perceive that in
this your wisdom is so high that my humble intelligence cannot
grasp it; but I wish to go to the apostolic see, to which of
necessity I have appealed, by licence of the king and you.”
“Leave us,” said the archbishop, “and the king, after taking
counsel, will announce to you his will.” When the bishop had
left the room and had been summoned back, Hugh de Beaumont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
rose and said to him, “My lord bishop, the king’s court and
these barons adjudge as just, that since you refuse to answer
touching the charge whereon the king through me has appealed
you, but cite him on his plea to Rome, you thereby forfeit your
fee.”</p>

<h2 id="chap_27">THE ILLNESS OF WILLIAM RUFUS,
AND THE APPOINTMENT OF ANSELM AS ARCHBISHOP
OF CANTERBURY (1093).</h2>
</div>

<p class="center b2"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Eadmer, <cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">Historia Novorum in Anglia</cite>, ed. Rule, p. 30.
(Rolls Series.)</p>

<p>One day one of the chief men of the realm, a favourite of
the king, happened to say to him among other things in the
course of conversation: “We have never known a man of
holiness so great, we honestly believe, as Anselm abbot of
Bec; he loves nothing beside God, and, as the whole of his
work makes manifest, he covets nothing transitory.” The
king rejoined with a sneer, “No, not even the archbishopric of
Canterbury.” The other replied, “No, not even that has a
very great attraction for him, in the opinion of myself and
many others.” Whereupon the king swore that the abbot
would rush to accept it with open arms, if he had the slightest
hope of attaining to it, and added, “But, by the Holy Cross of
Lucca,” as he was accustomed to swear, “neither he nor any
other shall be archbishop at present, except myself.” He had
scarcely spoken when he was seized by illness and took to his
bed, growing daily worse until he was at the point of death.
Why continue? All the chief men of the whole realm came
together, bishops, abbots and all the nobles, looking for nothing
but his death. The sick man was urged to take thought for
the salvation of his soul, to open the prisons, to set free the
prisoners, to unloose the bound, to pardon debts, to restore
to liberty the churches still in bondage under his lordship, by
setting pastors over them, and above all the church of Canterbury,
“the oppression whereof,” they said, “lays a hateful
burden upon the whole church of Christ in England.” Anselm
at this time, in ignorance of this event, was staying in a town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
not far from Gloucester, where the king lay sick. He was
commanded, therefore, to come to the king with all speed and
by his presence to comfort and strengthen him on his deathbed.
Hearing such news he made haste to come, and on his
arrival came to the king, who asked him what he deemed the
most wholesome counsel for a dying man; the abbot asked to
be first informed what counsel had been given to the sick prince
by those around him before his own coming. He heard and
approved, adding: “It is written, ‘Begin by confession to the
Lord’; wherefore it seems to me that he should first make
a good confession of all that he knows himself to have done
against God, and should promise without insincerity to amend
all if he recover, and then should order to be performed without
delay what you have advised him.” This precise counsel was
approved, and the task of hearing the confession enjoined upon
the abbot. The king was informed what Anselm had urged
as the best means for the saving of his soul, and straightway
he acquiesced and with a contrite heart promised to do everything
which the abbot’s judgment decided, and to conduct the
whole of his life in gentleness and justice. To this he pledged
his faith, and made his bishops sureties between him and God,
sending one of them in his stead to make this his vow to God
upon the altar. The order was written and confirmed by the
royal seal, that all prisoners in the whole of his dominion should
be released, all debts irrevocably cancelled, and all offences
committed hitherto consigned to everlasting oblivion. Moreover
righteous and holy laws were promised to all people, the
inviolable observance of justice, and a weighty and deterrent
trial of abuses. All men rejoiced and God was blessed herein,
and urgent prayers were offered for the salvation of so good
and great a king.</p>

<p>Thereupon all good men entreated the king to release from
her long widowhood the common mother of the whole realm
by instituting a pastor thereto. He willingly consented and
admitted that he had changed his mind. The question, therefore,
was asked, who was most worthy to enjoy this honour,
and while all were hanging on the king’s decision, he himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
announced, amid the unanimous acclamation of all, that abbot
Anselm was worthiest thereof. Anselm was alarmed at his
words and grew pale; and when he was forced to approach
the king to receive investiture of the archbishopric from his
hand by the pastoral staff, he resisted with the whole of his
strength, and declared that for many reasons it was altogether
impossible.... He said: “I am the abbot of a monastery
of another realm, having an archbishop to whom I owe obedience,
an earthly prince to whom I owe submission, and monks
to whom I owe the ministrations of counsel and assistance.
To all these I am so bound that I can neither abandon the
monks without their consent, nor loose myself from my prince’s
lordship without his permission, nor disown obedience to my
bishop without peril to my soul unless he absolve me.” The
bishops rejoined, “That is a light matter, all will readily consent.”
He replied, “Not so; what you purpose can never be.”
Thereupon they dragged him to the sick king and set forth his
obstinacy. The king was distressed almost to tears ... but
recognising that the labour of all of them was in vain, he
ordered them all to fall on their knees at his feet, to see
if by that means he could be induced to consent. To what
end? When they knelt, he knelt too before them and would
not alter his first decision. They were angry with him, and
blaming their own stupidity for the delay they had suffered by
listening to his objections, they cried out “The pastoral staff,
bring the pastoral staff hither.” Then, seizing his right hand,
some dragged, others pushed the struggling abbot, and gradually
they reached the sick man’s bedside. The king proffered
him the staff, but he closed his hand against it and wholly
refused to take it. The bishops struggled to unclasp his tightly
clenched fingers, that the staff might be thrust into his hand.
But after they had wasted their efforts for some time, and he
groaned with the pain inflicted upon him, at last his forefinger
was raised but bent backwards, the staff was laid against his
closed hand and squeezed and held in it by the hands of the
bishops. The whole throng cried out, “Long live the bishop,”
the bishops and clergy lifted up their voices and began to sing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
“<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Te deum laudamus</i>,” and carried rather than led the bishop
elect to the nearest church, he resisting the while as well as he
could, and saying: “It is all void, it is all void.” After they
had performed the customary ritual in the church, Anselm
was brought back to the king and said to him, “I tell you, my
lord king, that you will not die of your illness, and I wish you
to know this that you will be able to set right what has now
been done with me, for I have not consented and do not consent
to its ratification....” The king however ordered him
to be invested without delay and diminution with all things
belonging to the archbishopric within and without, and further
that the city of Canterbury, which Lanfranc in his time held of
the king as a fee, and the abbey of St. Albans, which not only
Lanfranc but also his predecessors are known to have held,
should pass as an alodiary<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> possession for ever to Christ
Church, Canterbury, for the redemption of his soul.... The
king recovered, as Anselm had foretold, and soon undid all the
good that he had decreed in his illness, and ordered it to be
annulled. The prisoners who had not yet been released he
ordered to be kept more straitly than usual, those who had
been released to be retaken if possible, old debts now pardoned
to be exacted in full, pleas and offences to be recalled to their
original standing, and to be tried and decided by the judgment
of men who were concerned rather to subvert justice than
to maintain and defend it, and interested rather in oppressing
the wretched and in spoiling men of their wealth than in
correcting any crime. Wherefore there grew throughout the
realm so vast a woe and so woeful a waste that he who remembers
it, I judge, remembers to have never seen the like in
England. Indeed every evil that the king had done before his
illness seemed a good thing in comparison with the evils he
did after his return to health. And if any man will know the
source from which they flowed, they can judge by his answer
to the bishop of Rochester, when the latter in friendly conversation
warned him after his recovery that he should in all
things behave more circumspectly towards God: “Be sure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
bishop,” he said, “by the Holy Cross of Lucca, that God
shall never have me good because of the evil He has brought
upon me.”</p>

<h2 id="chap_28">THE QUARREL OF WILLIAM RUFUS AND ANSELM (1093&ndash;94).</h2>

(Rolls Series.)</p>

<p>At that time the king, straining with all his power to seize
Normandy from his brother Robert, spent lavishly on this
object a large sum of money collected from every possible
quarter, so that he began to experience not a few difficulties
which were thought incompatible with the king’s dignity. The
new prelate was therefore recommended by his friends to offer
to the king 500<i>l.</i> of silver, which he did, hoping and believing
their promises that hereby he would secure thenceforward the
king’s lasting favour, and would obtain his willing support for
all godly works, and win peace and protection for the interests
of the church within and without against all enemies. The
king, hearing of this offer, expressed his thanks with the word
“Excellent.” But certain evilminded folk, as usual, induced
the king contemptuously to reject the money offered. They
said, “Here is a man whom you have honoured, enriched and
exalted above all the chief men of England; yet now, when
he ought to give you 2000<i>l.</i> or at least 1000<i>l.</i>, considering your
necessity, in return for your lavish favours, he offers a miserable
500<i>l.</i> Do not put up with it, change your mind, and you
will see that he will be influenced by the fear which others
feel, and, to recover your goodwill, will be only too glad to
double his offer of 500<i>l.</i>” The king, in fact, pursued this plan
with all his subjects; when any of them offered him any money,
with the sole desire to gain his favour, he rejected the gift,
unless the amount tallied with his desires, and refused to admit
the donor to his continued favour, unless he would increase the
gift to the king’s satisfaction. These grumblers, therefore,
expected that Anselm would be moved by fear like the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
and driven forthwith to fulfil the king’s wishes by increasing
the sum. So he was informed that the king had rejected his
money, which amazed him. He went to the king and asked
if the refusal was the king’s own act or not. Being told that
it was so, he expostulated with him, saying, “My lord, I beg
you not to do so; do not refuse to take what I now offer you;
for though it be your archbishop’s first gift, it will not be the
last. Indeed I maintain that it would be more profitable and
more honourable to you to take little from me with affectionate
freedom and at frequent intervals than to seize much by forcible
exactions involving servility. Admit affectionate freedom, and
you shall have at your service myself and my all; insist on
servility, and you shall have neither.” The king was wroth,
and said in a passion, “Mind your own affairs, and I will mind
mine; away with you!” He rose and went, meditating, it
may be, that it was not without significance that on the first
day of his entry into his see the gospel had been, “No man
can serve two masters.” Quickly recovering himself, he said,
“Blessed be God Almighty, who of His mercy has preserved
me from all evil report. For had the king graciously accepted
what I offered him, verily the evil men who abound would
have deemed it money promised beforehand for the bishopric,
and now rendered under the cloak of a free gift. But now
what shall I do? I will give the money intended for the king
not to him but to Christ’s poor for the ransom of his soul, and
will devoutly pray to Christ to pour down His grace upon him
and defend me from all evil.” He afterwards sued for the
king’s favour by messengers, but obtained it not because he
would not double the money, and so after the festival (Christmas)
he left the court, busying himself with the distribution
of his offering to Christ’s poor, as he had determined....</p>

<p>Some days afterwards, by the king’s command, almost all
the bishops assembled at Hastings with the chief men of
England, the bishops to bless and the others to accompany
the king on his intended passage to Normandy. And father
Anselm came also to pray urgently for the protection of the
king from the perils of the sea. The wind, however, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
unfavourable for the king’s crossing, and king and barons were
delayed there more than a month....</p>

<p>On one day he came to the king according to his wont, and
sitting by him began to speak thus, “My lord king, you have
resolved to cross the sea and subdue Normandy to your sovereignty.
But in order that these and other your desires may
turn out to your prosperity, I pray you, lend your aid and
counsel to the restoration to this your realm of the Christian
religion, which has now almost wholly perished in many ways.”
He answered, “What aid, what counsel?” “Command,” said
Anselm, “if it please you, that councils as of old be held, that
things done amiss be discussed in common, and that discussion
be followed by trial, trial by conviction and conviction by
judgment. For no general council of bishops has been held
in England since you became king and for many years before.
In consequence many evils have grown up, and with none to
check them, have waxed overstrong by the pernicious force
of custom.” The king rejoined, “When I think fit, I will deal
with these matters, and not at your will but at mine. The
question shall be raised later.” And he added with a sneer,
“As for you, what do you propose to talk about in a council?...”
He replied, “There are many abbeys in the land destitute of
their pastors, on account whereof the monks abandon their
order for worldly indulgence and pass away without confession.
Wherefore I counsel, I pray, I warn you to examine the matter
carefully, and to institute abbots according to God’s will, that
by the destruction of monasteries and the damnation of monks
you yourself come not to perdition, which God forbid.” The
king could restrain his anger no longer, but said, quite beside
himself with passion, “What business is that of yours? Are
not the abbeys mine? What? are you to do as you please
with your towns, and not I with my abbeys?” He replied,
“They are yours indeed, for you to defend and maintain as
their guardian, but they are not yours for you to break into
and lay them waste. We know they are God’s, that his
ministers may live thereby, and not that your expeditions and
wars may be undertaken from their revenues. You have many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
towns and the rents thereof for the ample administration of
your affairs. May it please you to leave to the churches what
is theirs?” “By heaven,” said the king, “your words are
intolerable; your predecessor would never have dared to speak
so to my father. I will do nothing for you.” Anselm realised
that he was talking to the winds, and rose and left him.</p>

<p>Feeling, however, that the king’s former anger was manifest
in such answers, and reflecting that, if the king’s heart were
incensed, there would be no peace, for the sake of the general
welfare, and to achieve more abundant results for God by
securing the royal favour for himself, he humbly sued the
king through the mouth of the bishops, freely to receive him
into his friendship. “If he refuses,” he said, “let him say
why; and if I have offended, I am ready to make amends.”
This was reported to the king, who answered, “I have nothing
to blame him for, but I will not extend my favour to him, for
I hear no reason why I should.” When the bishops brought
this answer, he was puzzled by the words “I hear no reason
why I should.” They said, “The mystery is clear enough;
if you want peace, you must offer him more money. Lately
you proffered him 500<i>l.</i>, and he refused to take it, because it
was too little; if you will take our advice and do what we do
in similar circumstances, give him now the same 500<i>l.</i> and
promise him a like sum to be taken by you from your men;
we are sure that he will restore you to favour and permit a
peaceable fulfilment of your wishes. We can see no other
way out of it, and in our own case, we have no other way in
face of such obstacles.” He at once grasped the effect of this
advice upon himself, and said “I cannot take that way. You
say that though he brings no charge against me, he is yet so
much enraged that he can be appeased only by 1000<i>l.</i>; now
if I, a new bishop, can appease him with such a gift, his anger
will break out again habitually, demanding a like sop. Apart
from that, after the death of Lanfranc, my predecessor, of
venerable memory, my men were robbed and plundered; and
shall I, before I have done anything to restore their estate, rob
them, naked as they are, nay, break the hearts of men already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
stripped? God forbid....” They replied, “At least, we are
sure, you will not refuse the 500<i>l.</i> you offered before.” He
answered, “I will not give him even that, for when I offered,
he rejected it, and besides, I have already given the greater
part to the poor, as I promised.” The king was told, and
ordered this reply to be brought to him: “Yesterday I hated
him much; to-day I hate him more; let him know that to-morrow
and after I shall hate him always worse and worse.
I will count him no further as father or archbishop; I entirely
abominate and curse his blessings and his sermons. He may
go where he chooses; let him wait no longer to bless my
passage.” So we<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> hastened away from the court and left him
to his will. For his part, he crossed to Normandy, and though
he spent enormous sums of money, he could by no means
conquer it.</p>

<h2 id="chap_29">THE FIRST CRUSADE (1095).</h2>
</div>

<p class="center b2"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;William of Malmesbury, <cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">De gestis regum Anglorum</cite>,
ed. Stubbs, vol. ii., pp. 390, 393, 398. (Rolls Series.)</p>

<p>In the year 1095 after the Incarnation of Our Lord, Pope
Urban II., who then filled the apostolic see, passed over the
Alps and came to France. The ostensible cause of his coming
was that after being driven from Rome by Guibert’s violence
he might win over the churches north of the Alps to acknowledge
him. His more secret purpose was less well known, to
wit, by Bohemond’s counsel, to stir up wellnigh the whole
of Europe for an expedition to Asia, so that amid so great
a commotion in all countries mercenaries might easily be
secured for Urban to attack Rome, and Bohemond Illyria and
Macedonia.... However, whatever might have been the
occasion of his journey, his coming was of great and glorious
benefit to Christians. A council, then, was summoned at
Clermont, the most famous city of Auvergne.... A clear
and forcible sermon, as a priest’s sermon ought to be, was
addressed to the people, touching an expedition of Christians
against the Turks.... The audience was filled with enthusiasm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
and shouted approval, delighted with the eloquence,
and attracted to the pilgrimage; and forthwith, in the council,
many of the nobility knelt before the Pope and consecrated
themselves and theirs to God’s warfare; among them was
Aymer, the mighty bishop of Puy, who afterwards commanded
the host with wisdom and increased its numbers with his
eloquence. So in the month of November, in which the
council was held, all departed to their own homes; and forthwith
the report of the good news spread throughout all the
world and stirred the hearts of Christians with a pure emotion,
which was so universally diffused, that there was no people so
remote, so obscure, as not to contribute its proportion; for not
only were the Mediterranean countries fired by the enthusiasm,
but all who dwelt in the utmost islands or among savage nations
and had heard the name of Christ. The Welshman left his
forest-hunting, the Scotsman forsook his friendly lice, the Dane
abandoned his endless drinking bouts, the Norwegian deserted
his raw fish. The husbandmen left the fields, houses were
emptied of their inmates, whole cities went abroad. There
was no regard for ties, love of country was of small esteem,
God alone held men’s vision. Stored up barns, hoarded
treasures, all that might satisfy the tiller’s eager hopes or the
miser’s greed, were abandoned; they hungered only after the
journey to Jerusalem. Joy went with the travellers, grief
oppressed those who stayed at home. Those who stayed at
home? You might have seen husband and wife and all their
children on the march; you would have laughed to see them,
furniture and all, setting off in carts. The roads were too
narrow, the ways too strait, for those who took the journey,
so thick the multitudes jostled and thronged. The number
surpassed men’s imagination, though the travellers were estimated
at six millions. Never, beyond a doubt, did so many
nations combine for one same purpose, never did a host so
unorganized submit its undiscipline to one, nay, to no command.
For most wonderful of all it was to see so vast a throng move
slowly through all Christendom, yet never led to plunder, and
none to restrain them. All were afire with mutual love, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
that if any man found in his possession what he knew not
to be his, he exposed it everywhere for many days to be claimed,
and the finder’s desire meanwhile was checked, until the loser’s
need might be satisfied.</p>

<p>After this Robert, duke of the Normans, having determined
to set out with others to Jerusalem, sent envoys to England to
request his brother king William to renew the peace between
them and to lend him 10,000 marks of silver, receiving from
him as security the duchy of Normandy. The king, anxious at
once to satisfy his request, commanded the nobles of England,
each of them according to his means, to advance him money
with all speed. Therefore, bishops, abbots and abbesses broke
up their gold and silver church-ornaments, and earls, barons
and sheriffs despoiled their knights and villeins, and brought
to the king a large sum of gold and silver. And he crossed the
sea in the month of September, made peace with his brother,
lent him 6,666<i>l.</i>, and received Normandy from him as security.</p>

<p>Over and above the deeds of which we knew the king to be
constantly guilty, when we were living in England, news of
some fresh atrocity was brought every day by those who came
thence, wherein he was understood to be so hardened against
God’s righteousness, that many of that country, men and
women alike, cherished sentiments about him other than the
Christian law teaches Christians to hold about a Christian.
And hereon I have thought fit to digress a little, that my
charges may not be thought bare assertion. I will set out
simply what we heard, without affirming its truth or falsity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Those who came told us that almost at that very time, when
the king was staying at Rouen, the Jews dwelling in that city
came to him, complaining that some of their number had
forsaken Judaism and recently become Christians, and asking
the king to take money to force them to reject Christianity
and return to Judaism. He consented, received the price of
apostasy, and ordered the Jews concerned to be brought to
him. What shall I add? Many of them were compelled by
his threats and menaces to deny Christ and readopt their former
error. Moreover there was at that time a young Jew, to whom
one day, as he was walking along the road, another young man
appeared, seemly in face and vesture. On being asked whence
he came and who he was, he replied that of old he had been
converted from Judaism to Christianity, and that he was
Stephen, the first martyr. “And I have descended now from
Heaven,” he said, “that you may reject the Jewish superstition,
and, becoming a Christian, be baptized in Christ by my name.”
He spoke and vanished out of sight. The young man was
seized with fear and straightway went to a priest and clearly
related what he had seen and heard, and confessing that he
believed in Christ, forthwith received the grace of baptism.
When his father discovered the fact, he was smitten to the
heart with sharp grief, and amidst his anxious efforts to find
means of restoring his son to his faith, learned that William,
king of the English, for the sake of money, had lately given
back such converts to Judaism. He went therefore to him
and in plaintive tones set forth how he had lost his son. He
prayed for his compassion and asked that the boy, whom he
loved as an only son, might be restored to his father’s laws by
the royal sanction. The king made no answer to his requests,
not hearing a reason why he should meddle in such a matter.
The Jew understood the secret of his silence and at once
promised to give him 60 marks of silver if he would restore
his son to Judaism. So the king ordered the young man
to be brought before him and addressed him as follows:
“Your father complains that you have become a Christian
without his permission. If this is so, I command you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
satisfy his desire and without any hesitation to return at once
to Judaism.” The youth replied “My lord king, I suppose you
are jesting.” He replied in a rage, “Jest with you, you guttersnipe?
Be off and do at once what I bid you, else, by the
Holy Cross of Lucca, I will have your eyes put out....”
The young man was driven out and found his father at the
door eagerly awaiting the outcome of the matter, and to him
he said with anger, “Son of death, heir of eternal perdition,
is not your own damnation enough, but you must drag me down
with you. Christ has now become my father, and God forbid
that I should ever recognize you for my father, for your father
is the devil.” While he was speaking, at the king’s order the
Jew was ushered into the king’s presence, and the king said to
him, “I have done what you asked; pay me what you promised.”
He replied, “My son is now more confirmed than ever
in his confession of Christ, and has become more bitter against
me than before, and yet you say ‘I have done what you asked,
pay me what you promised.’ Rather finish first what you
began and then discuss promises; for that was the covenant
between us.” The king replied “I have done what I could;
but, though I have not succeeded, I certainly shall not do
something for nothing.” And the trembling Jew had much
ado to secure his release from half the sum promised, on
payment of the other half.</p>

<h2 id="chap_32">THE DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS (1100).</h2>
</div>

<p class="center b2"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Florence of Worcester, <cite>Chronicon</cite>, ed. Thorpe, vol. ii., p. 44.</p>

<p>On 4 August ... William the younger, king of the English,
while hunting in the New Forest, which is called Ytene in the
language of the English, was struck by an arrow carelessly
aimed by a Frenchman, Walter, surnamed Tyrel, and died;
and his body was carried to Winchester and buried in the old
minster in the church of St. Peter. His fate astonished none,
for popular report affirmed it to proceed from the great strength
and vengeance of God. For in ancient times, to wit, in the
days of king Edward and other kings of England, his predecessors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
the same district flourished exceedingly with God-fearing
inhabitants and with churches; but, at the command
of king William the elder, the men were driven away, the
houses pulled down, the churches destroyed and the land given
over to the habitation only of deer; and that was the cause, so
folk believed, of the mischance. For Richard, brother of the
same William the younger, had perished in the same forest
some time before, and a little while afterward his nephew,
Richard, son of Robert duke of the Normans, was struck,
while hunting, by an arrow shot by one of his knights, and
perished. In the place where the king fell a church had stood
in former times, but, as we said before, it was destroyed in the
time of his father.</p>

<p>In the days of the same king ... there were many portents
in the sun, the moon and the stars; the sea, too, often overflowed
the shore and drowned men and beasts, and swept away
many towns and houses; in the county of Berkshire, before
his death, blood flowed from a well for three weeks; the devil
also showed himself to many Normans in horrible shape in the
woods, and spoke with them touching the king and Ranulf
(Flambard) and certain other persons. And no wonder, for
in their time almost all legal justice was silenced, and in causes
before the courts money alone swayed the powers that were.
In truth at that time many obeyed the king’s will rather than
justice, and Ranulf, contrary to ecclesiastical law and the rule
of his order (for he was a priest), took from the king at farm
first abbeys, and then bishoprics, the prelates whereof were lately
dead, and paid to him yearly therefrom large sums of money.
His ingenuity and shrewdness were so active and in a short
time became so useful, that the king appointed him justiciar
and collector of the whole realm. In the enjoyment of such
wide powers, everywhere throughout England he exacted fines
from the rich and wealthy, despoiling them of their possessions
and lands; and incessantly burdened the poor with heavy and
unjust taxes, and in many ways, both before he received his
bishopric and after, oppressed great and small alike, and that
too, until the king’s death.</p>

<p>He was very strong and stern over his land and his men and
towards all his neighbours, and much to be feared; and
through evil men’s counsels, that were ever comfortable to
him, and through his own covetousness, he was ever tormenting
this people with an army and unjust taxes, whereby in his
days all right fell, and all unright in the sight of God and of
the world uprose. God’s churches he brought down; and the
bishoprics and the abbeys whereof the heads passed away in
his days either he sold them all for money, or held them in his
own hand and let them to farm, because he would be the heir
of every man, ordained and lay; and so on the day that he
died, he had in his own hand the archbishopric of Canterbury
and the bishopric of Winchester and the bishopric of Salisbury,
and eleven abbacies, all let to farm. And though I take long
to tell it, all that was hateful to God and oppressive to men, it
was all customary in this land in his times, and therefore he

<p>In his (William Rufus’) days was founded the Cistercian
order, which is now believed and alleged to provide the surest
path to Heaven. To speak of this here is not irrelevant to the
work I have undertaken, since it is England’s glory to have
bred the man who was at once the founder and the organizer of
this rule. To us he belongs, and in our schools as a boy he
passed his early years. Therefore, if we are without envy, we
shall the more gratefully cherish his worth, the more intimately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
we learn of it; at the same time I am myself disposed to sing
loud his praises, because it is a noble trait to approve in others
those qualities, the lack of which in yourself you regret.
Harding was his name among the English, and he was born of
no very illustrious parentage. In early youth he was a monk
at Sherborne, but when, as he grew up, worldly desires
troubled him, disgusted with his cloth, he went first to Scotland
and afterwards to France. There, after some years education
in the humanities, he felt the prickings of the love of God, for,
after his manhood had put away childish follies, he went to
Rome with a clerk, his fellow-student; neither the length nor
the difficulty of the journey, nor their poverty, could restrain
them from chanting daily the whole psalter as they went and
returned. Already, indeed, the renowned man was meditating
at heart the purpose which by God’s grace he began to execute
soon after; returning to Burgundy, he received the tonsure in
Molesme, a new and great monastery, and readily acknowledged
the first principles of the rule, as he had formerly seen
them; but when other observances were proposed to him
which he had neither read in the rule nor ever seen, he began
to press for the reason of the same, humbly and as becomes a
monk.... His opinions, spreading, as happens, from one to
another, justly moved the hearts of such as feared God, lest
perchance they should run or had run in vain. The question,
therefore, was debated in many chapters, and ended in the
agreement of the abbot himself that superfluous observances
should be given up and only the essential principles followed.
Thereupon two of the brethren were chosen, of equal learning
and piety, to enquire by vicarious research touching the will of
the founder of the rule, and to expound the results of their
enquiry to the others. The abbot strove earnestly to obtain
the consent of the whole convent, but it is difficult to uproot
from men’s minds old habits of thought, since they are
reluctant to eschew what they have earliest digested; so well-nigh
all refused to accept the new doctrine, because they
loved the old. Only eighteen, among whom was Harding
(who is also called Stephen), persisted in their holy determination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
and left the community with their abbot, declaring that
the rule could not be observed in its purity in a place where
the soul, in spite of struggle, was overwhelmed by wealth and
gluttony. So they came to Cîteaux, a place once simple
woodland, but now so marked by the abundant piety of monks,
that it is deservedly held to be conscious of the divine presence
itself. There, by the countenance of the archbishop of Vienne,
now Pope, they entered upon a labour worthy of renown and
reverence for all time.</p>

<p>Truly many of their rules seem severe, but these especially:
they wear no fur or linen, nor that finely woven woollen cloth
which we call <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">staminium</i>; they never have breeches, except
when they are sent on a journey, and then they wash and give
them up on their return; they have two gowns with hoods, but
put on no added garment in winter; but in summer, if they
choose, they lighten their clothing. They sleep robed and girt,
and never return to their beds after matins, but they so order
the hour of matins that it shall be light before the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">laudes</i>; they
are so careful of the rule that they deem no jot or tittle should
be disregarded. Immediately after the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">laudes</i> they chant the
prime, whereafter they go forth to work for stated hours.
They accomplish all their labour and chanting for the day
without any artificial light. None is ever absent from the
daily services, none from compline, except the sick; the cellarer
and hospitaller, after compline, serve the guests, observing
however the strictest silence. The abbot allows himself
nothing that is not allowed to others, and is everywhere
present, everywhere tending his flock; only he eats not with
the rest, since his table is always with pilgrims and the poor.
None the less, wherever he be, he is sparing of speech and
food, for neither for him nor for others are laid more than two
courses; only the sick may have lard and meat. From
5 September to Easter, regarding no festival except Sundays,
they break their fast but once a day. They never leave the
cloister except to work, nor do they converse then, or at any
time, except in turn to the abbot or prior. They observe
unwearied the canonical hours, adding nothing foreign thereto,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
except a vigil for the dead. They use in divine offices the
Ambrosian chants and hymns, so far as they could learn them
at Milan. They bestow care on guests and the sick, but inflict
intolerable crosses on their own bodies for the salvation of
their souls.... In a word, the Cistercian monks are to-day
a pattern for all monks, a mirror for the diligent, a spur to the
slothful.</p>

<p>Flowing hair was then in vogue, and extravagance of dress;
and the fashion of shoes with curved points was then adopted;
it was the ambition of the young gallants to rival women in
suppleness of limb, in mincing gait, in easy gesture and
uncovered bust. Effeminate and soft, they refused to be what
birth had made them.</p>

<p>In the twenty-ninth year (of Henry I.) an event occurred in
England which may appear strange to our long-haired dandies,
who forget their sex and eagerly ape the fashions of women.
An English knight, who was proud of his luxuriant hair, was
terrified by the pricks of conscience into a dream, in which he
thought a man was strangling him with his own locks. Shaken
out of his sleep, he straightway cut off his too abundant curls.
The fashion spread throughout England, and, since a recent
shock commonly stirs the feelings, almost all knights tolerated
without ado the reasonable cropping of their hair. But this
decency did not last long; scarcely had a year passed, when all
who claimed to be men of court lapsed to their earlier vice;
they vied with women in the length of their hair, and when
they had little, they wore false; forgetful, or rather ignorant,
of the saying of the apostle, “If a man have long hair it is a
shame unto him.”</p>

<p>Henry, by the grace of God king of the English, to all his
faithful, as well French as English, of the whole of England,
greeting.</p>

<p>Know ye that I, by the mercy of God and by the common
counsel of the barons of the realm of England, have been
crowned king of the same realm. And because the realm was
oppressed by unjust exactions, I, out of reverence for God and
out of the love which I have towards all of you, grant first
that the Holy Church of God be free, so that I will neither sell
it nor put it to farm, nor, upon the death of archbishop or
bishop or abbot, will I take aught of the lordship of the church
or of the men, until a successor enter therein. And all the evil
customs, with which the realm of England was unjustly
oppressed, will I remove therefrom. Which evil customs I set
forth in part here.</p>

<p>If any of my barons or earls or others who hold of me shall
die, his heir shall not redeem his land as he did in the time of
my brother, but he shall relieve it with a lawful and just relief.
In like manner the men of my barons shall relieve their lands
from their lords by a lawful and just relief.</p>

<p>And if any of my barons or other men wish to give his
daughter in marriage, or his sister or niece or kinswoman, he
shall speak with me thereon. But neither will I take anything
of his for licence herein, nor will I forbid him from giving her
in marriage, unless he wish to unite her with my enemy. And
if, upon the death of a baron or other man of mine, his daughter
be left heir, I will give her in marriage with her land by the
counsel of my barons. And if a husband die and his wife be
left and she have no children, she shall have her dower and
marriage, and I will not give her to a husband except according
to her will; and if a wife be left with children, she also shall
have her dower and marriage, so long as she live chastely, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
I will not give her in marriage except according to her will;
and the guardian of the children’s land shall be either the wife
or another kinsman, who shall have the juster claim. And I
command that my barons behave in like manner towards the
sons or daughters or wives of their men.</p>

<p>The common moneyage which was taken by cities and by
counties, which also was not taken in the time of king Edward,
I wholly forbid henceforth. If any man be taken, whether
moneyer or other man, with false money, right justice shall be
done thereon.</p>

<p>All pleas and all debts which were due to my brother, I
pardon, except my right farms, and except those which were
agreed upon for the inheritances of others, or for those matters
for which others were justly liable. And if any man have
made any covenant for his own inheritance, I pardon it, and all
reliefs which were agreed upon for right inheritances.</p>

<p>And if any of my barons or men shall fall sick, I grant that,
as he shall give his money, or dispose it to be given, it shall be
so given. But if he be prevented by battle or sickness and do
not give his money or dispose it to be given, his wife or
children or kinsfolk, and his lawful men, shall divide it for his
soul as shall seem best to them.</p>

<p>And if any of my barons or men shall do amiss, he shall not
pledge his money by way of mercy, as he did in the time of my
father or my brother, but according to the manner of the fault,
so shall he make amends, as he would have made amends
before the time of my father in the time of other my predecessors.
And if he be convicted of treason or crime, he shall
make amends in like manner.</p>

<p>I pardon also all murder-fines incurred before the day on
which I was crowned king. And for such as shall be made
hereafter, amends shall be made justly, according to the law of
king Edward.</p>

<p>By the common consent of my barons I have retained the
forests in my hand as my father had them. Of my own gift I
grant to the knights, who do service for their lands by hauberk,
the lands of their demesne ploughs quit of all gelds and of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
work, so that, as they have been relieved at so great a burden,
they may so equip themselves well with horses and arms, that
they may be prompt and ready for my service and for the
defence of my realm.</p>

<p>I establish a firm peace in the whole of my realm and
command it to be henceforth observed. I give back to you the
law of king Edward, with those amendments by which my
father amended it by the counsel of his barons.</p>

<p>If any man have taken aught of mine or of any other man
since the death of king William, my brother, the whole shall
be restored speedily without amends. And if any man shall
retain aught thereof, he in whose possession it shall be found
shall make heavy amends to me.</p>

<p>Witness: Maurice bishop of London, and William bishop-elect
of Winchester, and Gerard bishop of Hereford, and
Henry the earl, and Simon the earl, and Walter Giffard the
earl, and R. de Muntfort, and Eudo the butler, and Roger
Bigot. Fare ye well.</p>

<p>Henry by the grace of God king of the English to his most
pious spiritual father, Anselm archbishop of Canterbury,
greeting and all affection.</p>

<p>Know, dear father, that my brother king William is dead,
and that I, by the will of God, elected by the clergy and by the
people of England, and now consecrated king, though reluctantly
by reason of your absence, request you as my father, together
with all the people of England, that as soon as you can you come
to give your counsel to me, your son, and to the said people, the
care of whose souls has been committed to you. I commit
myself and the people of the whole realm of England to the
counsel of you and of those who ought with you to give me
counsel; and I pray you not to be vexed that I have received
the blessing as king in your absence; for as touching that, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
would have received it more gladly from you than from any
other. But necessity compelled, for enemies wished to rise up
against me and the people whom I have to govern, and therefore
my barons and the same people refused to permit that it
should be longer delayed; wherefore on that account I received
it from your vicars. Indeed I would have sent to you certain
from my side; by whom I would have also despatched some of
my money to you, but by the death of my brother the whole
world was so unsettled touching the kingdom of England, that
they could not in any wise have come safely to you. Therefore
I recommend and warn you not to come through Normandy
but by Witsand, and I will cause my barons to meet you at
Dover and money to be brought to you; and you shall find
resources, God willing, wherefrom you shall be well able to
repay any loan you have received. Therefore, my father,
make haste to come, that our mother church of Canterbury,
long troubled and desolate for your sake, suffer no longer the
desolation of souls. Witness bishop Gerard, and William,
bishop elect of Winchester, and William Warelwast, and earl
Henry, and Robert FitzHamon, and Hamon the sewer,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> and

<h2 id="chap_38">THE INVESTITURE CONTROVERSY (1100&ndash;1107).</h2>

<p>A few days after his return, Anselm came to the king at
Salisbury and was welcomed by him; he accepted the king’s
excuse for having assumed the royal dignity without waiting
for the benediction of him whose right he knew it to be, and was
thereupon required to do homage to the king according to the
custom of his ancestors, and to receive the archbishopric from
the king’s hand. He answered that in no wise either would he
or could he consent so to do, and when asked why, he immediately
set forth in plain words what he had agreed to on these
and certain other matters in the council at Rome, saying in
conclusion, “If the lord the king will accept these terms, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
accepting, observe them, there shall surely be a firm peace
between us; but if not, I do not see that my remaining in
England will be either useful or honest; especially as, if he
has granted any bishoprics or abbacies, I must altogether
reject communion both with him and with those who have
accepted them. I have not returned to England to dwell
there, unless the king will obey the Pope of Rome. Therefore
I beg that the king will make what order he will, that I may
know which way to turn.” The king, on hearing this, was
gravely disturbed. It seemed to him a serious matter to lose
the investitures of churches and the homage of prelates, but not
less serious to suffer Anselm to leave the realm before he
himself was fully established on the throne. On the one hand
he thought he would be losing as it were half the realm, and
on the other he feared that Anselm would go to his brother
Robert, who had by that time returned to Normandy from
Jerusalem, and persuading him to submit to the apostolic see,
which he knew to be a most easy thing to do, would make
him king of England. A truce, therefore, from controversy on
either side was asked for until Easter.... To this Anselm
consented....</p>

<p>Not long after ... a friendly letter was sent by the king to
him.... asking him to come to the king, who wished the
matter to be settled and had another plan. Hoping to hear
that God of his grace had touched the king’s heart, he went,
as he was ordered, to Winchester. There the bishops and
chief men of the realm were gathered together, and by their
common assent Anselm agreed that ... envoys should be
sent by both parties to Rome to explain to the Roman pontiff
face to face that either he must abandon his original decision,
or submit to the expulsion of Anselm and his party from
England and lose the submission of the whole realm and the
profits which he was accustomed to derive yearly from the
same. Two monks therefore were sent by Anselm, to wit,
Baldwin of Bec and Alexander of Canterbury, not indeed to
urge the Roman pontiff in any way to abate the rigour of
justice on Anselm’s behalf, but partly to bear testimony of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
threats of the court which the Pope must straightway believe,
and partly to bring back to Anselm a final decision from the
apostolic see. To accomplish the same purpose the king sent
three bishops, Gerard of Hereford, lately made archbishop of
York, Herbert of Thetford and Robert of Chester....</p>

<p>The journey at length accomplished, the envoys reached
Rome together, and announced the cause of their coming to
the apostolic ears, each party presenting its own case, and
humbly asked for the Pope’s counsel to put an end to the
quarrel. He heard their story and found no words in which to
express his amazement. But when he was urgently pressed by
the bishops to consult his own interests and mitigate the
strictness of his predecessor’s rigid decision, that peace might
everywhere abound, he declared that he would not do it even to
ransom his person. “Shall one man’s threats,” he asked with
indignation, “drive me to annul the decrees and institutes of
the holy fathers?” That was the end of the matter. Hereupon
he sent letters to the king and Anselm, one to each ... which
we set out before our readers’ eyes, the better to reveal their
contents:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Paschal the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to his
dear son Henry, king of the English, greeting and apostolic
benediction.</p>

<p>“We give thanks to the Lord, the King of kings, who by the
grace of His goodwill has raised you to the throne, and by the
grace of His goodwill and of His ineffable mercy has watched
over you as a Christian king. We ask, therefore, that He may
make the good beginnings of your reign grow to better things,
and to the end watch over His gifts bestowed upon you. For
you have repudiated the impiety of the king your brother,
which, as you see, has been terribly avenged by the divine
judgment; you have restored the churches to freedom, you
have begun to honour the clergy and to reverence their heads,
the bishops, and in them Christ the Lord. We are therefore
confident that you will be equally wise to the end and persevere
in the same excellence; except that there are men of perverse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
spirit who strive to prepare your royal heart for divine wrath
through the investiture of bishops and abbots. Their counsels
in this behalf should be shunned by you like poison, that you
offend not Him by whom kings reign and the mighty decree
justice. If you propitiate Him, of a truth your reign will be
blessed, and you will win undisputed power and riches. But
if, which God forbid, you offend Him, neither the counsels of
barons, nor the aid of knights, nor arms nor riches will avail
to help you when He shall begin to overthrow you. In the
honour of God, in the liberty of the church, you shall have in
us a friend and helper. Be sure that no man shall wrest you
from our friendship, if you abstain from investitures, if you
yield to the church due honour and preserve its freedom
ordained by God. Indeed, by the judgment of the Holy Ghost,
we prohibit kings and princes and all laymen alike from investitures
of churches. It is not fit that a mother should be sold
into slavery by a son, receiving a spouse whom she has not
chosen. For her Spouse she has our King and Lord, and may
He keep you of His mercy in power and piety, and lead you
from an earthly to a heavenly kingdom. Amen.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>“Paschal the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to his
venerable brother and fellow-bishop, Anselm, greeting and
apostolic benediction.</p>

<p>“You are not ignorant that it is by the counsel of the divine
will that your piety presides over the realm of England. For
when, to avoid the hatred of a perverse king, you chose to
withdraw and to dwell by yourself far from the turmoil of
England, living unto God, Almighty God wrought an awful
judgment upon the perverse king. But by the vehement
demand of the whole people and by the wonderful devoutness
of the new king, you have been recalled to the primacy which
for God’s sake you abandoned. Thanks be to God that episcopal
authority ever abides in you, and that though you are set
among a barbarous folk, you cease not to proclaim truth in
spite of the violence of tyrants and the favour of the mighty, in
spite of the kindled fire and the outstretched hand. We ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
therefore that what you are doing, you continue to do, that
what you proclaim, you proclaim to the end. For the inspiration
of Him, Who in the beginning was the Word, shall not be
wanting to our words and works. Nor will we be wanting to
Him Who is the power of God and the wisdom of God. For
we believe that we have the same inspiration as our fathers,
wherefore also we now speak.... In the truth thereof we
will guard against the lies of men. Wherefore in the late
Lateran council we re-enacted the famous decrees of our fathers,
proclaiming and prohibiting that no clerk whatsoever accept
churches or ecclesiastical gifts from the hand of a layman; for
this is the root of the vice of simony, when fools strive to win
the favour of secular persons in order to receive the honours of
the church. Therefore the reverend majesty of holy councils
has decreed that ecclesiastical elections shall be guarded from
the power of secular princes, in order that, as through Christ
only is the door of the church first opened to eternal life in
baptism and at the last in death, so through Christ only shall
be appointed the door-keeper of Christ’s fold, by whom Christ’s
sheep, not for hire but for Christ, shall be led in and out to
life eternal. These things, dear brother, might be treated at
greater length both in speech and argument, but it is enough to
have set forth a few considerations to your wisdom, which
abounds in divine utterances and is familiar with ecclesiastical
arguments. Teach these things, as you know befits your
primacy, which, moreover, we confirm to you as fully and
entirely as it was ever held by your predecessors, adding for
ourselves that so long as the divine mercy shall preserve your
piety in the realm of England, you shall not be subject to the
judgment of any legate, but only of ourself.”</p></blockquote>

<p>... On the return of the bishops and others who, as we
have said, were sent to Rome, the king, summoning the chief
men of the realm to London, called on Anselm by messenger
according to wont, either no longer to oppose him and the
customs of his predecessors, or to give up his primacy of the
realm. He replied, “Let the king be pleased to permit examination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
of the letters which have been brought, and, saving my
honour and my obedience to the apostolic see, I will do all in
my power to submit to his will.” The king replied, “Let his
own be examined, if he chooses, but mine shall certainly not
be shown at present.” He answered, “When it shall please
the king to show it at another time, he shall find me ready to
meet his present demands.” The king rejoined, “I have no
concern with letters, nor will I; let him say in plain speech
whether he will obey my will in all things.” On hearing this
many were filled with a great wonder, arguing that if the letter
had coincided with the king’s wishes, he would have made the
contents public of his own will, without any reference to
Anselm. At that time they were not known to us, yet the
more anxiously their secrecy was then preserved, the more
openly were their contents known a few days later. When
the letter to Anselm had been read and read again before all
who would hear it, the bishops who had come from Rome
asserted that they had received from the Pope at Rome a
verbal assurance quite contrary to the tenour of that letter and
even to the letter which they had brought to the king. Asked
what it was, they declared on their word as bishops that the
Pope himself had sent a message for the king’s private ears,
that as long as he lived the life of a good prince in other ways,
he would willingly bear with him on the matter of investitures
of churches, and would refrain from imposing the ban of
excommunication if he should invest religious persons by the
gift of the pastoral staff. He had refused to entrust to writing
the honour of a concession so great in case it should be brought
to the knowledge of other princes, who might usurp the same
privilege and despise the authority of the Roman pontiff....</p>

<p>On the first of August (1107) a council of the bishops,
abbots and chief men of the realm was held at London in the
king’s palace, and for three whole days the question of the
investitures of churches was discussed by the king and the
bishops in Anselm’s absence, some urging upon him to maintain
the practice of his father and brother in defiance of the
apostolic command. For the Pope, taking a firm stand upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
decree which had been published thereon, had conceded the
homage which Pope Urban had prohibited equally with investitures,
and thereby secured the king’s consent to his view of the
investitures.... Afterwards, in the presence of Anselm, and
the whole council standing, the king agreed and ordained that
from that time forward no man should be invested in any
bishopric or abbey by the king or the hand of any layman in
England by the giving of the pastoral staff or ring, Anselm on
his side granting that no man elected to be a prelate should be
deprived of consecration to the dignity he had received, by
reason of the homage which he should do to the king. Upon
this settlement of the dispute, institutions were made by the
king, without investiture of the pastoral staff or ring, by the
counsel of Anselm and the chief men of the realm, to almost
all the churches of England, so long bereft of their pastors.</p>

<p>The character and number of the burdens, under which the
whole of England was crushed at this time, are difficult, I
know, to describe. For the king, leaving Normandy because
he could not conquer the whole of it by the means described
above,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> returned to England to collect larger supplies of money
with which he might go back and subdue the remainder,
disinheriting his brother. In the levying of this money the
collectors showed no regard for pity or mercy, but all men
suffered a ruthless and outrageous exaction, as those who came
to us testified. Indeed you might have seen men who had
nothing to give driven from their own homes, or the doors of
their houses torn off and carried away, and themselves exposed
to wholesale plunder; or they were reduced to extreme poverty,
their mean furniture being seized, or at any rate persecuted
and tortured in other shameful ways. Against those who
were thought to have any wealth certain new and ingeniously
devised penalties were charged, and so, when they dared not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
venture to implead the king for the defence of their land, their
possessions were seized and themselves reduced to serious
distress. But these measures perhaps will be deemed slight
by some, because they were not peculiar to king Henry’s
reign; many a like oppression had been committed under his
brother, not to mention his father king William. Yet they
were thought harder and more intolerable, because much less
than usual was found to be extracted from a people already
despoiled and exhausted. But further, in the council of
London ... all priests and monks of England had been
prohibited from marriage, and this prohibition, during Anselm’s
exile, had been violated by many, who still retained or at least
took back their wives. The king, refusing to allow this sin to
go unpunished, ordered his ministers to implead the offenders
and take fines from them to expiate their sin. But since
many of them were found innocent of this offence, the money
demanded for the king’s use amounted to a smaller sum than
the collectors could have desired. Therefore they changed
their plan, the innocent were involved with the guilty in a
universal charge, and all parish churches were put in the king’s
debt and every one ordered to be redeemed by the parson who
served God therein. It was pitiful to behold. When the fury
of this exaction was at its height, and some men, who either
had nothing to give, or, in detestation of the outrageous
measure, refused to give on such a ground, and were contemptuously
robbed, imprisoned and tortured, the king chanced to
come to London; there nearly two hundred priests assembled,
it is said, robed in their albs and priestly stoles, and with naked
feet approached the king on his way to the palace. But, as it
happened, his thoughts were much occupied, and he was
entirely unmoved to pity by their prayers, or at any rate deemed
them unworthy of the honour of an answer, as if they were
men destitute of all religion, and ordered them to be driven at
once out of his sight. Their confusion thus worse confounded,
they approached the queen and begged her to intercede; but
though, it is said, she was moved by pity to tears, she was held
back by fear from intervening.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the king conquered Normandy in battle, and forthwith
notified the fact to Anselm by the following letter:</p>

<p>“Henry, king of the English, to Anselm, archbishop of
Canterbury, greeting and affection. We make known to your
paternity and holiness that Robert duke of Normandy, with
all the forces of knights and footmen which he could collect by
prayer or for hire, on a day named and agreed on, fought a
sharp fight with me at Tenchebrai; and at last by God’s
mercy we defeated him, and that without much loss on our
side. What more should I say? The divine mercy has given
into our hands the duke of Normandy, the count of Moretuil,
William Crispin, William de Ferrers and Robert de Stuteville
the elder, and other knights to the number of four hundred,
and ten thousand footmen, and Normandy itself. The number
of those slain by the sword was not great. This victory, however,
I attribute not to my own glory or vanity or strength,
but to the blessing of divine providence. Wherefore, reverend
father, humbly and devoutly I bow the knee to your holiness
and beseech you to beseech the supreme Judge, whose award
and pleasure has granted this triumph, so glorious and so
profitable to me, that it may not turn to my loss and damage,
but to the beginning of good works and the service of God, and
to the maintenance and strengthening of the estate of God’s
Holy Church in peace and tranquillity, that henceforth it may
persist in freedom and not be shaken by any shock of battle.”</p>

<p>Many men therefore argued that the king had gained this
victory because of his agreement with Anselm.</p>

<p>The Lord rendered to duke Robert his deserts, because, after
He had granted him glory in the wars of Jerusalem, he refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
the offer of the kingdom of Jerusalem, choosing rather to be

Normandy at his pleasure and returned to England, casting
into dark dungeons his brother, the illustrious duke, and the
count of Moretuil. Victorious, and now for the first time
undisputed king, he held his court at Easter in Windsor, where
the barons both of England and Normandy assembled in fear
and trembling. For before, both while he was young and
after he became king, he had been held in the greatest contempt;
but God, Who judges far otherwise than the sons of
men, Who exalts the humble and puts down the mighty,
deposed the famous Robert from the favour of all men, and
commanded that the glory of the despised Henry should shine

him three gifts, wisdom, victory and riches, and herewith he
prospered in all things and surpassed all his predecessors.</p>

<p>Meanwhile king Henry, noting that wellnigh the whole of
the realm had sunk for many causes into deep misery, began
to consider, by the advice of Anselm and the chief men of the
realm, how to palliate in some way the evils by which especially
the poor were weighed down. He wisely began this good
work with his own court. In the time of the king, his brother,
a great number of the company that followed his court were in
the habit of destroying and plundering indiscriminately, and
without any check or restraint, of wasting the whole of the
land through which the king passed. Another evil supervened.
Most of them, drunk with their own malice, when they could
not altogether consume all that they found in the houses into
which they forced their way, used to have the residue taken to
the market place by the very possessors and sold for their
private profit, or to light a fire and destroy it, or, if it were
drink, to wash their horses’ feet with it and pour the remainder
on the ground, or at any rate make away with it in some other
manner.... For these causes all men, on hearing of the
king’s coming, used to fly from their dwellings, in their anxiety
for themselves and their households, and make for the woods
or other places where they hoped to secure protection. King
Henry, eager to do away with this curse, published a prohibition,
and with stern and steady justice punished all who could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
be convicted of any of the practices I have spoken of, by
causing their eyes to be plucked out, or their hands or feet or
other members to be cut off. This justice was suffered by
many and proved a visible deterrent to the rest from inflicting
injury on others, if they would save whole their own persons.</p>

<h2 id="chap_44">THE SHIPWRECK OF WILLIAM, SON OF HENRY I. (1120).</h2>

<p class="center b2"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;William of Malmesbury, <cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">De gestis regum Anglorum</cite>, ed.
Stubbs, vol. ii., p. 495. (Rolls Series.)</p>

<p>By Matilda king Henry had a son named William, trained
and destined to the succession with tender hopes and great
anxiety; he was hardly twelve years old before all freemen of
England and Normandy, of every condition and rank, to what
lords soever they owed fealty, were compelled to become his
men by homage and oaths. As a boy he espoused and took to
wife the daughter of Fulk count of Anjou, herself but a girl,
receiving from his father-in-law the county of Maine for her
dower; moreover, when Fulk was bent on his journey to
Jerusalem, he commended his county to the king, if he should
live, to go to his son-in-law if he should not return. Many
countries, therefore, awaited the boy’s governance, and it was
thought that he would fulfil the prophecy of king Edward, and
it was said that the hope of England, cut down like a tree,
would burst again into flower in his person, put forth fruit, and
so might an end of evil be looked for. God willed otherwise.
This hope was shattered, for he was destined to an untimely
end. It happened that by the exertions of his father-in-law, and
of Theobald son of Stephen and Adela his aunt, Louis king of
France granted the lad Normandy, that after homage done he
might hold it by lawful right; this was planned and brought to
effect by the astuteness of his father, that the homage, which
he disdained to do himself by reason of his high sovereignty,
might be done by a tender child, who, it was supposed, was unlikely
to live. The negotiations and peaceable settlement of
these schemes occupied the king for a space of four years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
during the whole of which he stayed in Normandy. And yet
the peace, so brilliant, so carefully devised, and the hopes of
all men, raised so high, were brought to confusion by the
uncertainty of man’s lot. It was decided to return to England,
and on the evening of the 24th of November the king set sail
at Barfleur; a fair breeze filled his sails and brought him safe
to his realm and noble heritage. But the young man, now
seventeen years of age and a little more, endowed by his father’s
bounty with every honour except the name of king, ordered
another ship to be made ready for himself; and almost all the
young nobility, sharing with him the pleasures of youth,
flocked in his train. The sailors had drunk too freely, and the
drink excited their seaman’s enthusiasm; they swore that those
who had started first must speedily be left astern; for the
ship was excellent and fresh-fitted with new planks and rivets.
The night was now dark, when the young and inexperienced
band, overcome with drink, pushed out from the shore. The
ship flew swifter than the winged arrow, and cutting through
the curling billows, by the crew’s drunken carelessness struck
on a rock rising out of the sea not far from the shore. The
wretched men jumped up and shouting wildly strove long to
push the ship off the rock with their iron boat-hooks; but
fortune was against them and all their efforts were useless.
The oars also were dragged against the rock and snapped, and
the forepart hung jambed and shattered; and now some were
washed overboard, and others were drowned by the inrushing
water, when the ship’s boat was at length pushed off, and the
king’s son put in it; he could have reached the shore in safety,
had not his sister, the countess of Perche, struggling with death in
the larger vessel, with shrieks implored her brother’s help, and
begged him not to abandon her so cruelly. He was moved with
pity, ordered the skiff to be brought close to the ship to rescue
his sister, and thus through tenderness of heart pitifully met his
death; for at once a crowd of men jumped into the boat and
upset it, and all alike sank to the bottom. Only one man, a
rustic, escaped, and by clinging to the mast all night lived to
tell the whole tragic story the next day. No ship ever brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
on England misery so great, no ship was so notorious throughout
the world. With William perished also Richard, another
son of the king, the child of a woman without rank, born
before his accession to the throne, a young man of excellent
parts and dear to his father for his devoted service; also
Richard earl of Chester and his brother Otwell, the tutor and
guardian of the king’s son; also the king’s daughter, the
countess of Perche, and his niece, the sister of Theobald,
countess of Chester; and indeed almost the whole flower of
the court, whether knight or chaplain, and the sons of the
nobility in training for knighthood; for, as I have said, they
flocked to him from all sides, hoping to gain no small glory
from either amusing or serving the son of the king. The
disaster was increased by the difficulty of recovering their
bodies, which could not easily be found by the searchers
scattered along the coast; their noble limbs became food for
the cruel monsters of the deep.</p>

<p>The news of the prince’s death caused remarkable changes.
His father abandoned the celibacy observed by him after
Matilda’s death, scheming to beget heirs from a new queen.
His father-in-law, on the other hand, on his return home from
Jerusalem, faithlessly joined the party of William, son of
Robert duke of Normandy, giving to him in marriage his
second daughter and the county of Maine, his wrath being
roused and sharpened against the king for keeping the dowry
of his daughter in England after the prince’s death.</p>

<p>Experience of evil is a fatal hook to catch at men’s hearts
and enslave them to riches and transitory pleasures. This I
have learned from my own life. For when I was a child, a boy
and a young man, I used to see the glory of Robert, our bishop,
his gallant knights, his noble pages, his costly horses, his vessels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
of gold and silver gilt, his store of plate, his gorgeous waiting-men,
his purple robes and fine linen, and I thought there could
be no happier condition. And when all men, even they who
lectured in the schools on the vanity of the world, were
obsequious to him, and he himself, honoured as the father and
god of all, loved and valued the world overmuch, with what
countenance, with what temper would I have regarded any man
who should have told me then that this splendour, which all
admired, was contemptible? I would have judged him more
mad than Orestes, more querulous than Thersites. I thought
there could be no flaw in the exalted happiness of so exalted a
man. But when I became a man, I heard stories of the vilest
abuse being levelled at him, and felt that I would have fainted
if the same words had been spoken to me, who possess nothing,
before the same high audience. I began therefore to deem of
less account that inestimable happiness.</p>

<p>But since many worldly folk commonly experience the
bitterest reverses before their death, I will relate what befel
him before his end. He who had been justiciar of the whole
of England and greatly feared by all men, was twice impleaded
by the king at the end of his life before a justice of low birth,
and twice condemned with disgrace in the heaviest damages;
whereby his anguish of heart so affected him, that when I, now
his archdeacon, sat by him at dinner, I saw that he had been
moved to tears. I asked the cause, and he replied, “At one
time my attendants were sumptuously clothed; now the fines
exacted by the king, whose favour I have always sought, have
reduced them to sheepskins.” After this his despair of winning
the king’s friendship was so great that when the high praise
lavished on him by the king in his absence was reported to him,
he said with a sigh, “The king only praises a subject whom he
has determined utterly to ruin.” For king Henry, if one may
dare to say so, exercised consummate duplicity and possessed
an inscrutable mind. A few days afterwards, at Woodstock,
where the king had appointed a hunt, while conversing with
the king and the bishop of Salisbury, who were the highest in
the kingdom, our bishop was struck with apoplexy. Alive, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
speechless, he was carried into his house, and soon afterwards
died in the king’s presence. The great king, whom he had
always served, whom he had loved much and feared much,
whom he held in such honour, whom he trusted so entirely, no
more availed him in his last necessity than a beggar. Note
therefore that it was not said in vain, “Cursed be he that
trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm.” When therefore
the child or the boy or the young man regards the prosperous,
let him take thought of the uncertainty of their end, and
remember that even in this world they may be doomed to suffer
a decline full of misery. Bishop Robert was gentle and humble,
advancing many and crushing none, the father of orphans,
beloved by his household; yet this was the end of him.</p>

<p class="center"><i>What the Exchequer<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> is, and what is the reason of this term?</i></p>

<p><i>Disciple.</i> What is the Exchequer?</p>

<p><i>Master.</i> The Exchequer is a rectangular board about ten feet
in length and five in breadth, set like a table for those who sit
round it, and on every side it has an edge about four fingers
high, that nothing set thereon may fall off. Over the top of the
Exchequer is placed a cloth, bought in the Easter term, not
any sort of cloth, but black marked with stripes, which are
separated from each other by the space either of a foot or of a
hand’s breadth. And in the spaces there are counters placed
according to their value.... Now, though such a board is
called the Exchequer, yet this term is transferred also to the
court itself, when the Exchequer is sitting; so that if any man
obtain aught by an award, or anything be decreed by common
counsel, it is said to have been done at the Exchequer of this
or that year. And where men say to-day “at the Exchequer,”
they used to say “at the tallies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p><i>D.</i> What is the reason of this term?</p>

<p><i>M.</i> No better one occurs to me at present than that its shape
is like that of a chessboard.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> Would the wisdom of the ancients ever have so called it
for its shape only, when for a like reason it might have been
called “the Board?”</p>

<p><i>M.</i> I was right in calling you particular. There is another
but a less obvious reason. As in a game of chess there are
certain ranks of combatants, which advance or stand still by
certain rules or limitations, some presiding and others preceding:
so here some preside and others assist by reason of their
office, and none is free to transgress the established rules....
Moreover, as in chess the battle is fought between kings, so
here it is mainly between two that the war is waged and the
battle fought, to wit, the treasurer, and the sheriff who sits
there to render account; the others sitting by as judges, to look
on and give judgment.</p>

<h2 id="chap_47">THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXCHEQUER PROCEDURE IN RELATION TO ROYAL REVENUE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center b2"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Richard, son of Nigel, <cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dialogus de Scaccario</cite>, ed. Hughes,

<p class="center"><i>By whom and for what cause the testing of silver was instituted?</i></p>

<p><i>D.</i> By whom and for what cause was the testing or combustion
instituted?</p>

<p><i>M.</i> In order that this may be clear to you, we must go back
a little further. In the original condition of the realm after the
Conquest, as we have learned from our fathers, only victuals
were paid to the kings from their lands, and not gold or
silver by weight, and from such payments were supplied the
necessaries for the daily use of the royal household; and those
who had been appointed for this purpose knew certainly how
much came from each estate. But for the payments or gifts to
the knights and for other necessary things, money by tale<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
accrued from the pleas of the realm and from covenants,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> and
from the cities or castles where agriculture was not pursued.
This practice, then, continued during the whole time of king
William I., and as late as the times of king Henry his son; in
fact, I myself have seen people who saw victuals brought at
stated times from the royal estates to the court; and the officials
of the royal household knew precisely from which counties
wheat, and from which different kinds of meat or fodder for
horses or any other necessaries, were due. Upon payment of
these supplies according to the established amount of each, the
royal officials put them to the sheriff’s account, reducing them
to a sum of money; to wit, for a measure of wheat sufficient to
make bread for a hundred men, 1<i>s.</i>; for the carcase of a fattened
ox, 1<i>s.</i>; for a ram or a sheep, 4<i>d.</i>; and for the fodder of twenty
horses, also 4<i>d.</i> But as time went on, when the same king was
occupied beyond seas and in remote parts, repressing the tumult
of war, it came to pass that the sum necessary to meet these
operations was paid to him in money by tale. Meanwhile a
grumbling multitude of husbandmen used to flock to the king’s
court, or, what he thought worse, often used to press about him
as he passed by, offering their ploughs as a sign of the decay of
agriculture, for they were oppressed by innumerable hardships
on account of the victuals, which they brought from their
homes through all parts of the realm. The king listened to
their complaints, and after taking counsel with the nobles, sent
throughout the realm the wisest and most discreet men whom
he knew for the purpose. They went about surveying the
several estates with their own eyes, and, valuing the victuals
paid from them, reduced the same to a sum of money. They
decreed, further, that for the sum total of the amounts arising
from all the estates in one county the sheriff of that county
should be holden at the Exchequer; adding that he should pay
by scale, that is, 6<i>d.</i> on each pound by tale. For they thought
that in course of time it might well happen that the money,
then good, might deteriorate. In this opinion they proved
right. So they were forced to decree that the farm of manors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
should be paid not only by scale but by weight, which could
only be done by making considerable additions. This rule of
payment was observed for many years at the Exchequer, and
so in the old yearly rolls of that king you will often find written
“in the treasury 100<i>l.</i> by scale,” or, “in the treasury 100<i>l.</i> by
weight.” Meanwhile an able man arose, farseeing in counsel,
eloquent in speech, and by God’s grace preeminent in his
immediate grasp of the deepest matters; you would say that he
fulfilled what is written, “the grace of the Holy Ghost knows
not slow movements.” He was summoned to the court by the
king, obscure but not without nobility, and taught by his
example “how extreme poverty is the school of men.” Increasing
in favour with the king, the clergy and the people, he
was made bishop of Salisbury, enjoyed the highest offices and
honours in the realm, and possessed a consummate knowledge
of the Exchequer. As to this there is no room for doubt, for
the rolls themselves prove clearly that the Exchequer prospered
exceedingly under him. And it is from his stores that the
little knowledge we possess has trickled down. On this subject
I refrain at present from speaking at length, since owing to the
position which he filled, he has left behind him a lasting
memorial of his high genius. Afterwards by the king’s order
he came to the Exchequer; and after having sat there for
some years, he found that the method of payment described
above failed to satisfy the treasury to the full; for though it
appeared to obtain its dues by tale and by weight, it was
defrauded in actual substance. For it did not follow that if a

<h2 id="chap_48">THE OATH OF THE BARONS TO SUPPORT THE SUCCESSION OF MATILDA THE EMPRESS (1126).</h2>

ed. Stubbs, vol. ii., p. 528. (Rolls Series.)</p>

<p>In the twenty-seventh year of his reign, king Henry came to
England in the month of September, bringing his daughter
with him; and at Christmas following he summoned to London
a large number of the clergy and the barons, and there gave
the county of Salop to his wife, the daughter of the Count of
Louvain, whom he had wedded after Matilda’s death; grieved
that she had no issue, and fearing that she would remain
childless, he was meditating, with well-founded anxiety, the
question of his successor to the throne. This matter had
already been debated at length, and at this council he constrained
and bound with an oath all the barons of the whole
realm, and bishops and abbots also, to accept as their lady his
daughter Matilda, formerly empress, without any delay or
hesitation, if he should die without heir male. He pointed out
how disastrous to the country had been the loss of his son,
William, to whom the realm of right belonged; now there
survived his daughter, in whom alone inhered the lawful
succession, from her grandfather, her uncle and her father, all
kings, and on her mother’s side, for centuries past....</p>

<p>So all who were thought to be of weight in this council, took
the oath; first, William, archbishop of Canterbury, then the
rest of the bishops, and the abbots also. The first of the laity
to take the oath was David, king of Scotland, the empress’s
uncle; then Stephen, count of Mortain and Boulogne, nephew
of king Henry by his sister Adela; then Robert, the king’s son,
born before he came to the throne, whom he had created earl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
Gloucester.... There was, it is said, a remarkable dispute
between Robert and Stephen, who strove in generous rivalry to
be the first to take the oath, the one alleging the son’s privilege,
the other the nephew’s rank. Thus all the barons were bound
by fealty and oath, whereupon each departed to his own home.
After Whitsuntide, however, the king sent his daughter to
Normandy, ordering the archbishop of Rouen to betroth her to
the son of Fulk (count of Anjou), a prince of great nobility and
famous courage; the king himself made no delay in taking
ship to Normandy and uniting them in marriage. Whereupon
all men foretold prophetically that after his death they would
break their oath. I have myself often heard Roger, bishop of
Salisbury, say that he was loosed from the oath made to the
empress, for he had sworn it on condition that the king would
not give his daughter in marriage out of the realm without the
advice of him and the rest of the baronage; and that no one
authorized, no one had knowledge of the marriage except
Robert, earl of Gloucester, Brian Fitz Count, and the bishop
of Louviers. I do not relate this because I believe to be true
the words of a man who knew how to adapt himself to every
change of fickle fortune, but as a credible historian I set in
writing common opinion.</p>

<h2 id="chap_49">THE DISPUTED ELECTION OF AN ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY (1123).</h2>

<p class="center b2"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;<cite>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</cite>, ed. Thorpe, vol. i.,

<p>Then ... the king sent his writ over all England and bade
his bishops and his abbots and all his thegns that they should
come to his council on Candlemas Day (2 February) at
Gloucester to meet him, and so they did. When they were
there gathered, the king bade them that they should choose
them an archbishop of Canterbury, whomsoever they would.
Then spake the bishops among themselves and said that never
more would they have a monkish man to be archbishop over
them; and they all went together to the king and prayed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
they might choose a man of the clergy, whomsoever they
would, for archbishop; and the king granted the same to them.
This was all afore done through the bishop of Salisbury and
through the bishop of Lincoln before he was dead; for that
they loved never the rule of a monk, but were ever against
monks and their rule. And the prior and the monks of Canterbury
and all the other monkish men that were there withstood
it full two days, but it availed nothing, for the bishop of Salisbury
was strong and ruled all England, and was against it all
that he might and could be. Then chose they a clerk, William
of Corbeil by name; he was canon of a monastery called Chich
(St. Osyth). And they brought him before the king, and the
king gave him the archbishopric, and all the bishops accepted
him, but the monks and earls and almost all the thegns that
were there withstood him. At the same time the envoys of
the count (of Anjou) departed from the king unsatisfied and
cared nought for his favour. At the same time there came a
legate from Rome by name Henry; he was abbot of the
monastery of St. Jean d’Angely, and he came for the Romescot.
And he said to the king that it was against right that a clerk
should be set over monks, and therefore had the monks before
chosen an archbishop in their chapter according to right. But
the king would not undo it for love of the bishop of Salisbury.
Then soon thereafter the archbishop went to Canterbury, and
was there received, though it was against their will, and was
there forthwith consecrated as bishop by the bishop of London
and the bishop Ernulf of Rochester and the bishop William
Giffard of Winchester and the bishop Bernard of Wales and
the bishop Roger of Salisbury. Then soon after in Lent the
archbishop went to Rome for his pall, and with him went the
bishop Bernard of Wales, and Sigfrid abbot of Glastonbury,
and Anselm abbot of St. Edmunds, and John archdeacon of
Canterbury and Giffard, who was the king’s household chaplain.
At the same time the archbishop Thurstan of York went to
Rome at the Pope’s command, and came thither three days before
the archbishop of Canterbury came, and was there received
with great worship. Then came the archbishop of Canterbury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
and was there full seven nights before he could come to speech
with the Pope. That was because it had been given to the
Pope to understand that he had received the archbishopric
against the will of the monks of the monastery, and against
right. But that overcame Rome which overcomes all the
world, that is, gold and silver. And the Pope was appeased
and gave him his pall; and the archbishop swore obedience to
him in all things that the Pope enjoined upon him, on the altar
of St. Peter and St. Paul; and the Pope sent him home then
with his blessing.</p>

<p>In the thirty-fifth year King Henry stayed continuously in
Normandy, and though destined never to return, he often purposed
to return to England; but his daughter detained him
through constant quarrels arising from many causes by her
intrigues between the king and the count of Anjou. These
vexations irritated the king to anger and bitterness, which
resulted, some say, in a natural torpor, and afterwards, it is
thought, caused his death. At any rate, on his return from
hunting at St. Denis in the Forêt des Lions, he ate a dish of
lampreys, of which he was always fond, though they always
disagreed with him. A physician had forbidden him to eat
them, but the king ignored his sound advice on the poet’s
principles&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Ever we strive against the law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And love to taste forbidden fruit.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>So this meal brought on an evil humour and was followed
by the old violent symptoms, which resulted in a complete
collapse, his aged frame sinking into a deadly lethargy, the
natural struggle of his constitution provoked an acute fever in
the effort to throw off the poison in his system, but his powers
of resistance failing, the great king died on 1 December after a
reign of thirty-five years and three months....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>On the death of the great king Henry, his character was
freely discussed by the people, as is usual in the case of the
departed. Some asserted that three splendid gifts especially
distinguished him; supreme wisdom, for he was profound in
counsel, acutely farseeing and brilliant in speech; success in
war, for apart from other famous exploits he overcame the
king of France in battle; and wealth, in which he far surpassed
all his predecessors. Others, however, took a different point
of view, and urged that he was tainted by three vices; avarice,
because, like all his house, though rich, he impoverished the
poor with taxes and exactions, and snared them in the toils
of the informer; cruelty also, because he put out the eyes
of his kinsman, the count of Moretuil, when in captivity (this
horrible crime could not be known until death laid bare the
king’s secret acts), and other instances also were alleged, of
which I say nothing; and excess also.... Such was the
common division of opinion. But in the terrible time that
followed, amid the savage anarchy of the Norman traitors, all
that Henry had done, whether as king or despot, seemed more
than excellent in comparison with worse evil.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_51">THE ACCESSION OF STEPHEN (1135).</h2>
</div>

<p class="center b2"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;<cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gesta Stephani</cite>, ed. Howlett, vol. iii., p. 3. (Rolls Series,
Chronicles of Stephen, Henry II., and Richard I.)</p>

<p>When king Henry, giver of peace to his country and father
of his people, passed away in death, the unhappy event threw
the whole country into anarchy and total confusion. The
land, which during his reign had been the seat of justice and
the home of law, became on his decease a sink of iniquity and
a hotbed of all malice. England, formerly the abode of right,
the habitation of peace, the throne of piety, the mirror of
religion, became the dwelling-place of perversity, the refuge of
discord, the school of disorder, and the mistress of all rebellion.
The reverend bonds of sacred friendship were straightway
broken among the people, the most intimate ties of mutual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
kinship were loosed, and those who had worn the garments of
daily tranquillity were whelmed by the noise of battle and the
madness of war. For every man was seized with a new
passion for barbarity, to run riot against his neighbour, and to
reckon his glory by the measure of his wrongs to the innocent.</p>

<p>The established laws, that restrain an undisciplined people,
were wholly neglected, nay rather annulled, and men straightway
accomplished any crime which their unlawful passions
inspired. To use the words of the prophet, “There was no
soundness from the sole of the foot to the crown of the head,”
for from the lowest to the highest their minds were sick, and
either they wrought havoc or assented to the havoc which
others wrought. Even the wild beasts, which were aforetime
peaceably preserved in every district, as though confined by
enclosures, were everywhere loosed and hunted by all and
slain by all indiscriminately and without fear. This, indeed,
was a lesser evil, and a matter of small complaint; none the
less it was amazing how so many thousands of beasts, that
before had covered the whole country in thronging herds,
were now suddenly annihilated, so that out of so vast a number
you would scarcely discover two together. When at length
this great and indescribable plenty began so to decline that, as
men say, a bird was a rarity and scarce a stag could anywhere
be seen, folk turned their violence against each other and
robbed their neighbours, each plundering each in turn, and
plotting ambush and destruction for each other, as the prophet
said, “Man rose up without mercy against man, and everyone
was set against his neighbour.” Whatever crime was suggested
by passion in times of peace, was now swiftly brought
to an issue, when vengeance might seize its opportunity;
dissembled hatred and hidden malice burst forth to light and
was openly avowed.</p>

<p>While the English were indulging in this disastrous anarchy,
breaking the restraints of justice and freely rioting in all sorts
of wickedness, Stephen, count of Boulogne, a man of illustrious
and noble lineage, landed in England with a few followers.
King Henry, the peacemaker, loved him above all his nephews,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
not only because of his close tie of kinship, but for the manifold
excellencies that specially distinguished and adorned him.
What is rare indeed in our times, he combined riches with
modesty, generosity with courtesy; yet in all military encounters
and any siege of his enemies, he was daring and
courageous, cautious and persistent. Being the man he was,
as soon as rumours of king Henry’s death reached him, he
conceived a bold design in his heart, like Saul, and since he
was beyond seas, hurried to the coast, and obtaining by good
fortune a favourable breeze, steered for England on which his
thoughts were set. Landing, as said before, with a very
small following, he hastened to London, the metropolis and
queen of the whole country. Stirred by his coming, the whole
city came out to meet him with a noisy welcome, dancing with
joy and festivity to have recovered in Stephen another Henry,
the loss of whose guardianship they were but now deploring.
So the elder and more prominent men summoned a council,
and making common provision, in their judgment, for the good
estate of the realm, unanimously conspired to elect him king.
They urged that the whole realm was liable to the chances of
evil fortune, where the fount of all governance and the head of
justice was lacking. It was vital to them at once to establish
a king, who should restore peace for the common good, punish
rebels by force of arms, and justly administer the laws. Moreover
it was their right, their special privilege, on the death of
their king, themselves to set his successor on the throne.
There was no other at hand to fulfil a king’s part and put an
end to the perils of the realm, save only Stephen, who, it
seemed, had been brought to them by the will of Heaven; he
was worthy of the dignity in the eyes of all, as well by the
distinction of his birth as by the excellence of his character.
These points were heard and welcomed by all without open
contradiction, and by common counsel they decided to offer him
the throne and to appoint him king with their unanimous
support, both parties covenanting by a treaty confirmed, it is
said, by mutual oaths, that the citizens on the one hand would
support him with their wealth and maintain him with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
strength during his life, and that he, on the other hand, should
devote all his energies to the pacification of the realm for the
benefit of them all.</p>

<p>In haste came Stephen, younger brother of Theobald, count
of Blois, an active and resolute man, and though he had sworn
an act of fealty to king Henry’s daughter, yet, relying on swift
and bold measures, he tempted God by seizing the crown of the
realm. William, archbishop of Canterbury, the first to take
the oath to the king’s daughter, to his shame, blessed him as
king, wherefore God decreed against him the same judgment
which he had decreed against the priest who smote Jeremiah,
to wit, that he should die within a year. Roger too, the great
bishop of Salisbury, the second to take the aforesaid oath, and

Stephen’s claims; wherefore afterward by the just judgment
of God he was seized and tortured by the king whom he had
made, and suffered a miserable end. But why linger? All
who had sworn the oath, prelates and earls and barons alike,
offered their allegiance to Stephen and did him homage. It
was an evil omen that the whole of England, without hesitation,
without a struggle, in the twinkling of an eye, so suddenly
submitted to him.</p>

I promise that I will not do or permit any simony in the church

over ecclesiastical persons and all clerks and over their goods,
and the distribution of ecclesiastical goods is in the hands of
the bishops, and I confirm the same. I decree that the
immunities of churches confirmed by their charters, and their
customs observed by ancient use, remain inviolate, and I confirm
the same. I grant that all possessions and holdings of
churches, which they had on the day on which king William
my grandfather was alive and dead, be theirs freely and
absolutely, quit of all recovery by any claimants. But as
touching anything held or possessed before the death of the
king, whereof the church is now deprived, and for which the
church shall sue hereafter, I reserve the same to my indulgence
and dispensation for discussion or restitution. Moreover I
confirm all grants made after the death of the king by the
generosity of kings, the benefaction of princes, or the offering
or sale or exchange of the faithful. I promise to make peace
and to do justice in all things, and to preserve the same so far
as in me lies. I reserve to myself the forests which king
William my grandfather, and William the Second my uncle
made and held; the rest, which king Henry added thereto, I
give back and grant quit to the churches and the realm. And
if any bishop or abbot or other ecclesiastical person before his
death shall reasonably distribute his goods, or ordain the
distribution thereof, I grant that the same shall remain valid;
and if he be forestalled by death, the same distribution shall be
made for the salvation of his soul by the counsel of his church.
Moreover when sees be void of their proper pastors, both they
and all the possessions thereof shall be committed into the
hand and guardianship of the clerks and good men of the same

uproot all exactions and fines and injustices evilly imposed

<p>I scorn to give the names of the many witnesses, for he so
basely broke almost all his promises, as if he had sworn only in
order to show himself to the whole realm as an oath-breaker.
I must speak the truth, gentlest of princes though he was; for
if he had lawfully obtained the kingdom, and in administering
the same had not lent too ready an ear to the intrigues of evil-minded
men, verily little would have been lacking to his royal
dignity. Under him, however, the treasure of some churches
was plundered, their landed possessions were given to laymen;
the churches of the clergy were sold to aliens; bishops were
imprisoned and forced to transfer their goods; and abbeys were
granted to unworthy men, either to reward friends or to pay
debts. Still I consider that these evils must be ascribed to his
counsellors rather than to himself; for they persuaded him that
he need never lack money so long as there were monasteries
packed with treasure.</p>

<p>When the traitors perceived that he was a mild man, and
soft and good, and did no justice, then did they all wonder.
They had done homage to him and sworn oaths, but had held
no faith; they were all forsworn and brake their fealty; for
every mighty man built his castles and held them against him;
and they filled the land full of castles. They cruelly oppressed
the wretched men of the land with castle-works. When the
castles were made, they filled them with devils and evil men.
Then they took those men whom they deemed to have any
possessions, both by night and by day, husbandmen and
women, and put them in prison for gold and silver, and
tortured them with unspeakable torture, for never were martyrs
so tortured as they were. They hanged them up by the feet,
and smoked them with foul smoke; they hanged them by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
thumbs or by the head, and hung fires on their feet; they put
knotted cords about their heads, and twisted them so that it
went to the brain. They put them in dungeons, in which were
adders and snakes and toads, and so killed them. Some they
put in a “crucet hus,” that is, in a chest that was short and
narrow and shallow, and put sharp stones therein, and pressed
the man therein, so that they brake all his limbs. In many of
the castles were ... neck-bonds, so that two or three men had
enough to bear one. It was made thus, that is, fastened to a
beam; and they put a sharp iron about the man’s throat and
his neck, so that he might no wise sit or lie or sleep, but must
bear all that iron. Many thousands they killed with hunger;
I cannot and may not tell all the wounds or all the tortures
which they wrought on wretched men in this land; and it
lasted the nineteen winters while Stephen was king; and ever
it was worse and worse. They laid gelds on the towns
continually ...; when the wretched men had no more to give,
they robbed and burned all the towns, so that thou mightest
well go all a day’s journey, and thou wouldst never find a man
settled in a town, nor the land tilled. Then was corn dear, and
meat and cheese and butter, for there was none in the land.
Wretched men died of hunger; some went seeking alms, who
were sometime rich men; some fled out of the land. Never
yet had more wretchedness been in the land, nor did heathen
men ever do worse than they did; for everywhere they spared
neither church nor churchyard, but took all the goods that
were therein, and then burned the church and all together.
Nor spared they a bishop’s land, nor an abbot’s, nor a priest’s,
but robbed monks and clerks, and every man another who anywhere
could. If two or three men came riding to a town, all
the township fled before them, deeming that they were robbers.
The bishops and clergy cursed them ever, but nothing came
thereof, for they were all accursed and forsworn and lost.
However a man tilled, the earth bare no corn, for the land was
all undone with such deeds, and they said openly that Christ
slept, and his saints. Such and more than we can say we
endured nineteen winters for our sins.</p>

<p>Wales is a land of woods and pastures, adjoining England
on its nearest borders, and jutting into the sea on the other side
throughout its whole extent. It abounds in stags and fish, and
cows and oxen. The men it rears are savage, swift of foot by
nature, fighters by habit, and untrustworthy and unsettled alike.
When the Normans had conquered England in battle, they
established their sovereignty over this land also with numberless
castles. They crushed the natives with spirit, and civilised
them with patience; to ensure peace they imposed upon them
law and ordinances, and brought the land to such fertility and
abundant plenty, that you would deem it in no wise inferior to
the most fruitful part of Britain. But on the death of king
Henry, when the peace and concord of the realm were buried
with him, the Welsh, who always cherished mortal hatred of
their lords, wholly cast off the yoke to which their treaties
bound them, and issuing in bands from divers places, made
hostile inroads now here, now there, and with plunder, fire and
sword, wasted towns, burned houses, and slaughtered men.
They first attacked the district of Gower on the seacoast, a
beautiful and abundantly fertile spot, and surrounded and
entirely put to the sword a band of knights and footmen massed
against them to the number of 516. Thereafter, exulting in
the successful issue of their first uprising, they boldly overran
all the marches of Wales, bent on every crime and ready for
any mischief, neither sparing age nor reverencing rank, and
suffering no time or place to check their violence. Rumours
of this rebellion reached the ears of the king, who, to curb
their unbridled audacity, sent a force of knights and archers,
hired at a great cost of treasure, to crush them. Some, however,
after many glorious exploits, were slain there, while the
rest, unable to endure the savage onslaughts of the enemy,
after much toil and expense, retreated with dishonour.</p>

<p>The king (of Scotland) passing by Durham with his army
wasted the crops as far as the river Tees, and after his custom
broke into, plundered and burned the towns and churches
which he had earlier left untouched; and crossing the Tees
also, he began to work the same havoc. But the pity of God,
stirred by the tears of innumerable widows, orphans and
wretched men, suffered him no longer to practise impiety so
great without punishment. The preparations of him and his
men for such wickedness, all his stores, and what he intended
to do and whither to go, did not escape the men of Yorkshire.
So the barons of that county, to wit, archbishop Thurstan,

and William de Aumâle, Walter de Ghent, Robert de Bruce,
Roger de Mowbray, Walter Spec, Ilbert de Lacy, William
de Percy, Richard de Courcy, William Fossard, Robert de
Stutevill, and the other mighty and learned men, assembled at
York and discussed eagerly among themselves what plan to
adopt in this crisis. And since many hesitated, suspecting the
treason of others and mutually distrustful, and since they had
no commander and leader in war, for king Stephen their lord
was overwhelmed at that season with equal difficulties in the
south of England and could not come to them at present, and
since they feared to oppose their slight forces to numbers so
superior, it seemed as if they would altogether abandon the
attempt to defend themselves and their country; but Thurstan,
their archbishop, a man of great persistence and worth,
encouraged them with his speech and counsel. For he was the
pastor of their souls, and unlike the hireling, regarded not his
own safety by flight from the ravaging wolf, but rather was
torn by the keenest compassionate grief at the scattering and
undoing of his flock and the destruction of his country, and left
no step untried, no stone unturned, to find a remedy for such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
monstrous evils. Wherefore, both by the divine authority
entrusted to him and by the royal power then committed to him
in this matter, and by their fealty and honour, he faithfully
admonished them not to allow themselves through cowardice
to be overthrown in a single day by the worst sort of barbarism....
He also promised them that he would cause the priests of
his diocese to march together with them to battle, with their
crosses and their parishioners, and purposed himself, God
willing, to be present at the fight. At the same troubled season
Bernard de Balliol, one of the chief men of that district, came
to them from the king with a large body of knights, and both
on the king’s and his own behalf inflamed their hearts to the
same purpose. Urged therefore by the commands both of
their king and of their archbishop, they were all with one
accord confirmed in one same purpose, and each returned to his
home. Soon after they all reassembled at York with their
munitions and arms ready for war. So when they had done
penance privately, the archbishop enjoined on them a three-days’
fast with alms, and thereafter solemnly gave them
absolution and God’s and his own blessing, and though by
reason of great infirmity and the weakness of old age he was
carried in a litter wherever he was needed, yet to arouse their
courage he determined to go with them. But they forced him
to remain, beseeching him to be content to intercede for them
by prayer and alms, watching and fasting and by other godly
works; they would gladly fight the enemy for God’s church
and for His minister, as He should deign to help them, and as
their order demanded. Thereupon he delivered to them his
cross and the banner of St. Peter and his own men; and they
went to the town of Thirsk. Thence they sent Robert de Brus
and Bernard de Balliol to the king of Scotland, who was now
wasting the land of St. Cuthbert, as was said above; they
begged him, with the greatest deference and friendliness, to
desist thenceforth from his cruel measures, and promise
faithfully to ask the king of England to confer on Henry, son
of the king of Scotland, the county of Northumberland, which
that king had demanded. But he and his men hardened their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
hearts, rejected their overtures, and treated them with scornful
contempt. So Robert abjured the homage he had done to him,
and Bernard the fealty which he had once sworn, when
captured by him, and both returned to their fellows. Thereupon
all the chief men of that county, and William Peverel
and Geoffrey Halsalin from Nottinghamshire, and Robert de
Ferers from Derbyshire, and other weighty and wise men,
bound and fortified themselves in turn with oaths, that none of
them would desert the others in this business, so long as they
could each render mutual aid, and so all would either die or
conquer together. At the same time the archbishop sent to
them Ralph Novellus, bishop of Orkney, with one of his own
archdeacons and other clerks, who in his stead should enjoin
penance and give absolution to the bands of people daily
flocking thither from all quarters. He also sent to them the
priests with their parishioners, as he had promised them.</p>

<p>While, then, they were looking for the coming of the Scots,
the scouts, whom they had sent in advance, returned, reporting
that the king had already crossed the river Tees with his army,
and after his custom was now devastating their district. So
they went to meet him with the utmost haste, and passing
through the town of Northallerton, reached at break of day a
field two miles distant therefrom. Forthwith some of them set
up the mast of a ship in the middle of a scaffold which they had
brought, and called it the Standard.... On the top thereof
they hung a silver box containing the body of Christ, and the
banners of St. Peter the Apostle, and St. John of Beverley and
St. Wilfred of Ripon, confessors and bishops. This they did
that Jesus Christ our Lord, by the presence of His body, might
be their leader in the war which they had undertaken for the
defence of His church and their country, at the same time
providing hereby that, if any of them should be by chance
separated from their fellows and scattered, they would have a
sure signal by which to return to them and there find assistance.
They had hardly equipped themselves with arms for
the fight, when the king of Scotland was reported to be at hand
with the whole of his army ready and arrayed for battle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Therefore a great part of the knights left their horses and
became footmen, and the choicest of them were arrayed with
archers and set in the front rank, the rest, except the ordainers
and directors of the battle, being packed about the Standard in
the centre of the position, while the remainder of the troops
were massed around them on every side in a dense rampart.
The band of horsemen and the horses of the knights were withdrawn
a little farther, that they might not take fright at the
noise and clamour of the Scots. In like manner among the
enemy the king himself and almost all his men became footmen
and their horses were kept farther back. In the forefront of
the battle were the Picts, in the middle the king with his
knights and Englishmen; and the rest of the barbarous horde
pressed around on all sides. While they marched to battle in
such order, the Standard with its banners was seen not far
away, and at once the hearts of the king and his followers were
struck with a mighty fear and terror. But hardened in their
malice, they yet strove to fulfil the evil work begun by them.
So on the octave of the Assumption of St. Mary, 22 August,
between the first and third hours, the strife of this battle
began and ended. For straightway at the first onset innumerable
Picts were slain, and the rest threw down their arms and
basely took to flight. The field was choked with corpses, large
numbers were captured, and the king and all the residue fled.
Of that great army, all were either killed or captured or
scattered like sheep whose shepherd is smitten down, and in
wonderful wise, as if deprived of their sense, they fled as much
away from their own land into the neighbouring parts of their
enemies’ country, as towards their native land. But wherever
they were found, they were killed like sheep for slaughter; and
so by the righteous judgment of God, those who had woefully
slain and left the dead unburied were themselves more woefully
cut to pieces, and found no burial after the fashion of their own
or the foreigners’ land, but were exposed to dogs, birds and
wild beasts, or torn and dismembered, or left to decay and
putrefy under the open sky. The king also, who a short time
before in his excessive pride of heart and in the magnitude of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
his army seemed to have raised his head among the stars of
heaven, and therefore threatened to destroy utterly the whole
or the greatest part of England, was now shorn of his glory,
and accompanied by but a few, and covered with the utmost
shame and disgrace, scarcely escaped alive.</p>

<p>The degree of the divine vengeance appeared most clearly in
the fact that the army of the vanquished was beyond estimation
larger than that of the conquerors; nor could the number of
the slain be counted by any man. For, as many bear witness,
of the army which left Scotland alone, more than ten thousand
are reckoned to have been missing from the ranks of those who
returned, for throughout divers parts of Deira, Bernicia,
Northumberland, Cumberland and other districts, many more
were cut off after the battle than were slain in the battle. The
English army, on the other hand, lost few of its numbers,
speedily gaining a victory by God’s aid; and dividing the
booty which was found there in great quantities, in a short
while almost wholly broke up, and every man returned to his
own home, restoring to the churches with joy and thanksgiving
the banners of the saints which they had received. Verily
they had marched to this battle in their finest array and all
their wealth, as it had been to a royal marriage feast.</p>

<h2 id="chap_57">KING STEPHEN’S ATTACK ON THE BISHOPS (1139).</h2>
</div>

<p class="center b2"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;William of Malmesbury, <cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">Historia Novella</cite>, ed. Stubbs,
vol. ii., pp. 547&ndash;555. (Rolls Series.)</p>

<p>In the year 1139 after the Incarnation of our Lord, the
venom of malice, which king Stephen’s heart had long been
fostering, at length burst forth openly. Rumours were spreading
about England that earl Robert was on the eve of coming
from Normandy with his sister;<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> and in expectation thereof
many were disaffected towards the king, not only in will but in
deed, whereupon he repaired his losses by wronging others.
Many were seized at court against the king’s honour, on mere
suspicion of supporting the opposite party, and forced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
surrender their castles and submit to whatsoever conditions he
chose. There were at that time in England two exceeding
powerful bishops, Roger of Salisbury, and his brother’s son,
Alexander of Lincoln. Alexander had built the castle of
Newark, for the defence and honour of the bishopric, as he
said. Roger, who wished to display magnificence in the
building of castles, had erected more imposing fortifications at
Sherborne and Devizes, covering a large area of ground with
his buildings. He had begun a castle at Malmesbury in the
churchyard itself, hardly a stone’s throw from the principal
church. The castle of Salisbury, though it was the king’s own
property, had passed into his keeping by grant of king Henry,
and had been surrounded with a wall. Some of the powerful
laity, stirred to envy that they should be surpassed by clerks in
their wealth of heaped-up treasure and the size of their towns,
cherished in their hearts a sullen jealousy. So they poured
their discontents into the king’s ear, urging that it would all
unquestionably turn to the king’s destruction, since, as soon as
the empress came, they would welcome their lady by surrendering
their castles, drawn to her by the memory of her
father’s favours; they must therefore be at once forestalled and
constrained to yield up their fortresses.... The king, though
too favourably inclined to these advisers, for some time
pretended not to listen to their attractive proposals, easing the
bitterness of postponement either by his regard for the holy
office of the bishops, or, as I incline to think, by his fear of the
odium involved. In the end he only put off the execution of
the policy thus urged upon him until the first favourable
opportunity. That arose in the following manner.</p>

<p>A council of the nobility was held at Oxford on 24 June,
which the prelates aforesaid attended. The bishop of Salisbury
was most unwilling to go. I heard him say: “By my Lady
St. Mary, I know not why, but I have no liking for this
journey. This I know, that I shall be of as much use in the
court as a foal in a battle.” For so his heart foreboded ills to
come. Fortune, as it turned out, seemed to favour the king’s
desires; a riot arose between the men of the bishops and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
men of Alan, count of Brittany, over a claim to quarters; the
end was melancholy, for the men of the bishop of Salisbury,
who were then sitting at table, left their meal unfinished and
jumped up to fight. The affair was settled with curses first
and swords afterwards. The retainers of Alan were driven off,
his nephew barely escaping alive, while the bishops’ party did
not secure a bloodless victory, many being wounded and one
knight killed. The king seized the opportunity and ordered
the original instigators to summon the bishops to satisfy his
court for their retainers’ breach of the king’s peace; the
satisfaction demanded was the delivery of the keys of their
castles as pledges of their good faith. They were ready to give
satisfaction, but hesitated to surrender the castles, whereupon
he commanded that they should be closely confined, to prevent
their departure. So he took them to Devizes, bishop Roger
unbound, but the chancellor, his nephew (or more than his
nephew), in fetters; his object was to take the castle, which
had been built at a great and almost incalculable cost, not for
the glory of the church, as the prelate himself alleged, but, in
sober truth, to its detriment. Upon investment, the castles of
Salisbury, Sherborne and Malmesbury were surrendered to the
king; Devizes itself was given up after three days, bishop
Roger voluntarily imposing abstinence upon himself, that by
his personal suffering he might induce the bishop of Ely, who
held the castle, to yield.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> Alexander, the bishop of Lincoln,
gave way also without more ado, purchasing his delivery by
the surrender of the castles of Newark and Sleaford.</p>

<p>This action of the king was widely discussed from opposite
standpoints. Some said that the bishops were rightly dispossessed
of their castles, because they had defied the canons
in erecting them; they ought to be preachers of the gospel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
peace, not builders of houses that might harbour the authors of
evil. This view was urged and further amplified by the
arguments of Hugh, archbishop of Rouen, who stoutly
championed the king with all his eloquence. Others said the
contrary, and this party had the support of Henry, bishop of
Winchester, legate in England of the apostolic see, brother of
king Stephen.... “If bishops,” he said, “in any wise
forsake the way of justice, the canons, not the king, must be
their judge; they ought to have been deprived of no possession
without a public ecclesiastical council; the king had acted not
from zeal for righteousness, but for his own private benefit,
since he had not given the castles back to the churches, at
whose charges and on whose lands they had been built, but
had delivered them to laymen, and those by no means favourable
to religion.” He urged these considerations in the king’s
presence both privately and publicly, pressing him to deliver
and make restitution to the prelates, but his labour was wasted,
his plea ignored. Wherefore, determined to exert the force of
the canons, he summoned his brother instantly to appear before
the council which was to be holden on 29 August at
Winchester.</p>

<p>On the appointed day almost all the bishops of England,
with Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury ... came to Winchester....
The bull of Pope Innocent was first read in the
council, whereby from March 1, if I remember rightly, he had
delegated part of his charge to the lord bishop of Winchester
as his legate in England.... Next followed in the council
the legate’s address in Latin, prepared for the learned, touching
the disgraceful seizure of the bishops, of whom the bishop of
Salisbury had been taken in the chamber of the court, and the
bishop of Lincoln in his lodging, while the bishop of Ely,
fearing a like fate, had escaped disaster by a hasty flight to
Devizes; it was a scandalous crime that the king should have
been so led astray, at the instigation of others, as to order
violent hands to be laid on his men, especially bishops, in the
peace of his court. To the king’s dishonour was added an
offence against Heaven, to wit, that under the cloak of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
bishops’ guilt, churches were robbed of their possessions. He
was so indignant at the king’s outrage against God’s law, that
he would rather himself suffer great inconvenience to his
person and his possessions than that the episcopal dignity
should be so basely humiliated. He had many times warned
the king to make amends for his sin; and at last the king had
consented to the summoning of a council. The archbishop and
the rest should take counsel together as to necessary action;
he would not fail in the execution of their advice either out of
love for the king, his own brother, or out of fear of losing his
possessions, or even of risking his life.</p>

<p>While he was gradually enlarging upon this theme, the king,
confident in his own cause, sent earls to the council to ask why
he had been summoned.... They were accompanied by one
Aubrey de Vere, a man well versed in all kinds of legal causes....
The sum of his charges was as follows: bishop Roger
had committed many offences against king Stephen; he had
scarcely ever been to the court without riots being stirred up
by his men, presuming on his power; as often at other times,
so lately at Oxford they had assaulted the men and even the
nephew of count Alan.... The bishop of Lincoln had
instigated his men to riot, out of his old hatred against count
Alan. The bishop of Salisbury secretly supported the king’s
enemies and only disguised his treachery for the moment; the
king had many unquestionable proofs of it, the chief being that
he refused a single night’s lodging to Roger de Mortemer and
the king’s knights led by him, when they were in mortal terror
of the Bristol rebels. Everybody was saying that as soon as
the Empress should have come, he would attach himself to her
with his nephews and his castles. Therefore Roger was
seized not as a bishop, but as the king’s servant, who had at
once administered his affairs and received his wages. The
king had not taken the castles by force, but both the bishops
had voluntarily surrendered them to escape the accusation of
the rioting which they had incited in the court. The king had
found in the castles a small sum of money which was lawfully
his, for bishop Roger had collected it in the time of king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
Henry, the king’s uncle and predecessor, from the rents due at
the royal Exchequer. The bishop had willingly yielded up
both money and castles, for fear of his offences against the
king, and the king had no lack of witnesses thereto. For his
part, the king was willing that his agreement with the bishops
should remain unimpaired.</p>

<p>Bishop Roger exclaimed in reply that he had never been
king Stephen’s minister, and had never received his wages.
He threatened, moreover, in his anger, thinking shame to give
way to his misfortunes, that if he could not obtain justice in
that council for the property wrested from him, he would seek
it in the hearing of a higher court....</p>

<p>So much was said on both sides, and at the king’s request
the cause was adjourned to the next day, and then on the
morrow postponed to the following day until the coming of the
archbishop of Rouen. When he came and all were in suspense
to hear his opinion, he said that he allowed that the bishops
might have castles, if they could prove by the canons that they
might rightfully hold them; but since they could not, it was
the height of wickedness for them to fight against the canons.
“Grant,” he said, “that they may lawfully have them; surely,
in troubled times, it is the duty of the nobles, as among other
nations, to hand over all the keys of their fortresses to the will
of the king, who must make war for the peace of all. Therefore
the whole argument of the bishops falls to the ground;
either it is wrong according to the canons for them to have
castles, or, if this be permitted by the king’s indulgence, they
ought to hand over the keys, yielding to the necessity of the
situation.”</p>

<p>To this the aforesaid pleader, Aubrey, added, that the king had
been informed of the bishops’ intention, expressed among
themselves, to send some of their number to Rome against the
king. “And the king,” he said, “recommends that none of
you venture to do it, for if anyone should leave England against
his will and the dignity of the realm, he will perhaps find it
less easy to return. Furthermore he himself, seeing himself
aggrieved, appeals you at the court of Rome.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>The king’s despatch of this message, part warning, part
threat, made his purpose obvious, and in consequence the
council broke up, the king refusing to suffer canonical censure,
and the bishops failing to execute their plans against him, and
that for two reasons, first, because it would have been overbold
to excommunicate a prince without the Pope’s knowledge, and
second, because they heard, and some saw, swords unsheathed
about them. The struggle was no mere word-play, but a
matter of life and death. None the less, the legate and the
archbishop did not refrain from pursuing their duty; they
humbly knelt before the king in his chamber and prayed him
to take pity on the church and on his own soul and reputation,
and not to allow a schism to arise between state and church.
He courteously rose, but, although he moderated his disapproval
of their action, he made no effort to fulfil his good
promises, following rather his evil advisers.</p>

<p>A few words must be said, since occasion offers, of Roger’s
early career and progress, so that his wretched end may show
forth the majesty of the divine judgment. In the reign of king
William the younger he was a quite obscure priest, it is said,
who lived by his office in the outskirts of Caen. At that time
the young Henry was at war with his brother, and going on his
way with his knights chanced to pass the church in which
Roger ministered, and asked for service to be celebrated in his
presence; the priest acceded to the request, and was quick to
begin and swift to finish, pleasing the knights twice over, so
that they remarked that nowhere could knights discover a more
accommodating chaplain. So when the prince said “Follow
me,” he clove to him no less than Peter to his heavenly King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
at the same words. Peter left his boats to follow the King of
kings; he left his church to follow the son of a king; and as
chaplain at will to him and his knights, became a blind leader
of the blind. And though he was almost destitute of learning,
he profited so well by a native cunning that in a short while he
won his lord’s affection and took charge of his most secret
affairs.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>On December 11 (1139) Roger, bishop of Salisbury, was
relieved by death from the quartan ague which had long
afflicted him; they say that his illness was the result of
vexation at the severe and repeated injuries suffered by him at
the hands of king Stephen. For my part I consider that God
made him an example to the rich of the fickleness of circumstance,
that they should not put their trust in the uncertainty
of riches, for, as the apostle says, some who seek thereafter
have suffered shipwreck of their faith. He attached himself
first to prince Henry, afterwards king, by his wise management
of his household and his restraint on extravagance; for before
his reign Henry had been forced by his scanty resources to
study economy and spend carefully, owing to the ungenerous
behaviour of his brothers, William and Robert. Recognising
his habit of mind, Roger earned his gratitude in the time of his
poverty to such a degree that after his ascension to the throne,
Henry could deny him little or nothing that he chose to ask,
bestowing on him estates, churches, prebends of clerks, entire
abbeys of monks, and finally committing to his charge the
realm itself; at the beginning of his reign he made him
chancellor, and not long after, bishop of Salisbury. So Roger
heard causes, Roger regulated expenditure, Roger had charge
of the treasury, and that too both when the king was in England,
and also when he was in Normandy, as happened often and for
long periods, without an associate or a witness. Not the king
only, but the barons, even those who were secretly jealous of
his prosperity, and above all the king’s ministers and debtors,
gave him whatever he pleased. If any estate adjoined his own
and promised to serve his purpose, he extorted it forthwith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
either by prayer or purchase, or if that failed, by force. He
had no rival, in the memory of our own times, in the building
of palaces and the splendour of the houses which he erected
throughout his possessions, to maintain which his successors
but labour in vain. He spared no expense to beautify to the
utmost his own cathedral with marvellous ornament and
construction. Verily it was wonderful to behold how honours
of all kinds were heaped about him in rich abundance, and
gathered into his hand; how great was his glory, and how
unbounded his power, that he should have made bishops of his
two nephews, educated by himself to be men of notable
learning and industry; bishops, too, of no mean sees, but of
Lincoln and Ely, the wealthiest, I suppose, in the realm....</p>

<p>Under king Stephen his power declined, except that at the
beginning of his reign he secured for his nephews the offices of
chancellor and treasurer, and for himself the borough of
Malmesbury, the king often repeating to his friends, “By the
birth of God, I would give him the half of England, if he asked
for it, until times change; he shall tire of asking before I tire
of giving.” But in his latter years fortune, which before had
smiled upon him overmuch and overlong, struck him at last
with cruel scorpion-sting. What a blow it was to see men
wounded, who had served him well, to see his most devoted
knight cut to pieces, and on the next day to see himself a
prisoner, and his nephews, the great bishops, one forced to fly,
and the other, dearest of all, bound with chains; and afterwards,
on the surrender of the castles, to behold his treasures
plundered and himself in the council taunted with the vilest
abuse, and last of all, when he lay at Salisbury at death’s door,
to see the residue of his money and plate, which he had put
upon the altar for the completion of the church, carried off
against his will. Saddest of all I count it, and even I cannot
withhold my pity, that while many thought his end pitiful,
there were scarce any who pitied him; so much hatred and
envy had his excessive power drawn upon him, and that too
undeservedly, in the case of some whom he had himself
advanced to honour.</p>

<h2 id="chap_59">THE BATTLE OF LINCOLN (1141).</h2>

ed. Arnold, vol. ii., p. 307. (Rolls Series, Simeon of Durham.)</p>

<p>In the month of January at Lincoln, Ranulf, earl of Chester,
with his men, conspired and set their determination on
harassing the king and the realm. Now an earthquake was
thrice felt in the city at Christmastide. The plot was speedily
made known to king Stephen, who forthwith appeared there
and besieged the earl. The latter, however, escaped by night
from the tower in which he was shut, and straightway went to
Robert earl of Gloucester, whose daughter he had married, and
persuaded him and the household of the Empress to aid him,
and the Welsh likewise. The king’s elder supporters advised
him to gather an army, declaring that they had come unarmed
to have speech with him, and were not equipped for battle.
The king rejected their counsel, saying that the earls were but
lads inexperienced in war, and would not dare to attack him;
for he had been duped by the friendship of the young earls,
who supported the king with words, but cherished the strength
of his enemies with counsel and aid. So on the day of the
Purification of St. Mary, Robert earl of Gloucester, Ranulf
earl of Chester, and William de Romar, his brother, drew near
with a strong force, Robert being the leader and disposer of
the battle. The king also led forth his followers to the fight.
Alan, earl of Richmond, with his men, abandoned the king and
the struggle, before the battle was yet begun. William earl of
York, withdrew from the fight and exposed the king to peril.
His opponents therefore, with a boldness born of confidence,
cut down all who resisted. They captured Bernard de Balliol,
Roger de Mowbray, Richard de Courcy, William Fossart,
William Peverel, William Clerfeith and many others. Many
were slain and in the end all were scattered, including even
Waleran count of Mellent. But the king stood in the forefront
like a lion, braver than the bravest, afraid of no man’s onset.
He cut down all who came within reach, until his sword broke
in his hands. Thereupon a citizen of Lincoln put in his hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
a Danish axe; and it is difficult to describe the heroic courage
with which he faced his enemies. At last, however, he saw
himself left alone and almost all his fellows scattered; yet no
man dared to lay hands on him to take him. When earl
Ranulf attempted an attack upon him, the king smote him on
the head with the axe, and, beating him to his knees, taught
him not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think.
Finally, of his own will he summoned earl Robert, his cousin,
and to him, as the son of king Henry, he, himself a king,
consented to surrender his person.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> So he was taken to
Bristol and there put in safe keeping.</p>

<h2 id="chap_60">THE DEPOSITION OF KING STEPHEN (1141).</h2>
</div>

<p class="center b2"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;William of Malmesbury, <cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">Historia Novella</cite>, ed. Stubbs,
vol. ii., p. 574. (Rolls Series.)</p>

<p>On the second day after the Octave of Easter (April 11) a
council of archbishop Theobald and all the bishops of England
and many abbots was opened with great ceremony at Winchester
under the presidency of the legate. Those who were
not there sent reasons for their absence by proctor or letter.
The proceedings of this council I will set forth for posterity
with complete accuracy, since I was myself present, and I
remember the whole perfectly. On that day, after reading the
letters of excuse whereby some justified their absence, the
legate summoned the bishops apart and discussed with them
his secret intention; and afterwards the abbots, and last of all
the archdeacons, were summoned. Of his purpose nothing was
made public, but the thoughts and speech of all men were busy
with what was likely to be done.</p>

<p>On the third day the legate spoke to this effect: that by the
Pope’s condescension he held his place in England, wherefore
by his authority the clergy of England had been assembled at
this council, that they might deliberate together touching the
peace of the country, which was in grave peril of shipwreck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
In the time of king Henry, his uncle, England had been a
unique abode of peace, so that through the activity, the spirit
and the labour of that unrivalled prince, not only the natives,
whatsoever their might and rank, dared not make trouble, but
also by his example all neighbouring kings and princes themselves
yielded to peace and desired or forced their subjects to do
the like. The same king, some years before his death, had
caused the whole realm of England and the duchy of Normandy
to be bound by the oath of all bishops and barons alike
to his daughter, sometime Empress, his sole surviving child of
his first wife, if he should fail of a male successor by the wife
he had married from Lorraine. “And cruel fortune,” said he,
“grudged him his desire, so that he died in Normandy without
heir male. So, because it seemed long to wait for the Lady,
who delayed her coming to England, for she was dwelling in
Normandy, the peace of the country was provided for, and my
brother was suffered to become king. Yet, though I pledged
myself as surety between him and God that he would honour
and exalt Holy Church, and maintain good laws and uproot
evil, I grieve to remember, I am ashamed to recall, what
manner of king he has shown himself; how no justice has
been done on offenders, how peace was wholly destroyed
almost within a year; bishops seized and forced to surrender
their possessions; abbeys sold, churches plundered of their
treasures; evil men’s counsel regarded, and good men’s put
aside or wholly despised. You know how often I appealed to
him, as well by myself as by the bishops, especially in the
council summoned last year for this purpose, and yet I won
nothing but disfavour. It can escape no man, who thinks
aright, that I ought to love my mortal brother, but much
rather ought to regard the cause of my immortal Father.
Therefore, since God has judged my brother, permitting him
without my connivance to fall into the power of the mighty, in
my right as legate I have asked you all to assemble hither, that
the kingdom be not imperilled for lack of a ruler. Yesterday
the matter was discussed in secret before the greater part of
the clergy of England, whose right it is above all men to elect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
and ordain a prince. First, then, as is justly due, calling God
to our aid, we elect as lady of England and Normandy, the
daughter of the peaceful, the glorious, the wealthy, the excellent
king, incomparable in our times, and we promise her fealty and
maintenance.”</p>

<p>After all present had either suitably applauded his declaration
or by silence refrained from opposition, the legate added: “We
have summoned by messengers the men of London, who rank
almost as nobles in England through the greatness of the city,
and have sent them safe conduct, and I trust that they will not
delay their arrival beyond to-day; let us give them good grace
until the morrow.”</p>

<p>On the fourth day came the men of London, and after being
conducted into the council, put their case so far as to say that
they had been sent by the commune of London not to raise
strife but to pray for the release of their lord the king from
captivity; and that all the barons who had long been admitted
into their commune, earnestly demanded the same of the lord
legate and of the archbishop and all the clergy there present.
The legate answered them fully and clearly, and to prevent the
fulfilment of what they requested, repeated his speech of the
previous day, adding, however, that it did not become the men
of London, who were esteemed in England as nobles, to
support the cause of those who had abandoned their lord in
battle, by whose counsel he had dishonoured Holy Church, and
finally who appeared to show favour to the men of London
solely in order to drain them of their money.... They took
counsel together and said that they would report the decree of
the council to their fellows, and give it their countenance so far
as they could.</p>

<p>On the fifth day the council broke up after the excommunication
of many of the royal party, in particular, William Martel,
formerly king Henry’s butler, and afterwards sewer<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> to king
Stephen; he had grossly exasperated the legate by intercepting
and pilfering much of his property.</p>

<p>It was a heavy task, however, to win over the goodwill of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
the men of London, for though these events took place, as I
have said, immediately after Easter, it was only a few days
before Midsummer that they consented to receive the empress.
By that time the greater part of England had duly accepted
her governance.... But at the very moment when she
thought to secure possession of the whole of England, all was
changed. The men of London, always mistrusted, and murmuring
among themselves, now burst out into expressions of
open hatred, and even, it is said, lay in wait for the Lady and
her earls. They had warning and escaped, and left the city
gradually without rioting and with a kind of knightly discipline.
The empress was accompanied by the legate and David king
of Scotland, her uncle, and her brother Robert, then as always,
in all things, the partner of his sister’s fortunes, and, in short,
all of her party escaped to a man. The men of London,
learning of their departure, flew to their houses and plundered
everything which they had left behind in their haste.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_61">THE CAREER OF GEOFFREY DE MANDEVILLE (1143.)</h2>
</div>

<p class="center b2"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;William of Newburgh, <cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">Historia rerum Anglicarum</cite>, ed.
Howlett, vol. i., p. 44. (Rolls Series, Chronicles of Stephen,
Henry II., and Richard I.)</p>

<p>At the same time king Stephen seized Geoffrey de Mandeville
in his court at St. Albans, not indeed honourably and according
to the law of nations, but for his deserts and out of fear, with
an eye rather to the expedient than to the chivalrous. For
Geoffrey was a man of consummate daring and of equal
strength and cunning, strengthening his hold on the famous
Tower of London with two noteworthy added fortifications,
and achieving great ends by an ingenious subtlety. For these
reasons he inspired fear in the king himself, who, however, was
at pains to conceal his sense of wrong suffered at the other’s
hands, and watched for a convenient season to take his revenge.</p>

<p>Some years before the king had acquired the treasures of the
bishop of Salisbury, and, despatching a large sum of money to
Louis, king of the French, had married his son Eustace to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
Constance, Louis’ sister, planning by a match with so great a
prince to strengthen his son’s chance of succession against the
count of Anjou and his sons; and Constance was in London
with the queen, her mother-in-law. When the queen would
have gone elsewhere with her daughter-in-law, the aforesaid
Geoffrey, then master of the Tower, prevented her, and seizing
her daughter-in-law out of her hands, in spite of her stout
resistance, kept her, permitting the queen to depart with
ignominy. Afterwards at the king’s demand he reluctantly
resigned his noble booty to her father-in-law, who for the time
dissembled his just indignation. Now this wrong seemed to
have been at length forgotten, when the barons assembled at
the royal summons at St. Albans, and among them appeared
this bandit; whereupon, forthwith seizing the opportunity, the
king gave vent to his righteous anger and putting Geoffrey in
bonds, extorted from him the Tower of London with the two
other fortresses which he held. Stripped of his defences, but
released, his incapacity to rest, his mighty spirit, his almost
incomparable resource, and his extraordinary genius for evil,
led him to gather together an impious crew, at whose head he
burst into the monastery of Ramsey; without fear, he drove
out the monks, and turned the famous and holy place into a
den of thieves, and the sanctuary of God into the home of the
devil, ravaging the country round with constant sallies and
expeditions. Success increased his confidence, and going
further afield, he harassed and menaced king Stephen with the
boldest assaults. During this wild outburst it seemed as if
God was asleep and took no thought for human affairs, or even
his own, that is, the church; and pious men cried out of their
trouble, “Arise, why sleepest thou, O Lord?” But, as the
apostle says, after God endured with much patience vessels of
wrath fit for destruction, “he arose,” as the prophet says, “as
from sleep, and smote his enemies in their hinder parts,” that
is, in the latter years of those whose earlier career seemed
prosperous. In a word, shortly before the destruction of that
impious wretch, as is proved by the true testimony of many,
the walls of the church into which he had burst, and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
adjacent cloister, sweated with real blood, by which, as afterwards
appeared, was signified both the enormity of his crime
and the now imminent judgment upon the enormity. But
since the evil men, given over to a reprobate mind, were in no
wise frightened by a portent so horrible, their abandoned
leader, while storming a castle of his enemies among the serried
ranks of his followers, was struck on the head by the arrow of
a common footman; and from that wound the reckless fighter,
though at first he made light of it, died after a few days, and
took with him to hell the burden of the church’s anathema,
from which he could never be absolved.</p>

<p>His two most cruel followers, of whom one was over the
knights and the other over the footmen, are reported to have
perished by diverse mishaps. The one died by a fall from his
horse, his head being crushed on the ground and his brains
scattered; the other, Rainer by name, the chief destroyer and
burner of churches, when crossing the sea with his wife,
brought the ship to a standstill in mid ocean by the weight of
his sins. The sailors and others who were crossing at the
same time were reduced to stupefaction, but, following the
ancient example, cast lots, and the lot fell upon Rainer; and
when, to prevent the possibility of accident, they cast lots a
second and a third time with the same result, it was declared
to be the judgment of God. So, in order that all might not
perish with him and on his account, he was put out in a boat
with his wife and his ill-gotten wealth. The ship immediately
leapt forward and was borne on its usual course. But the boat
sank under the weight of the sinner, and was overwhelmed in
the waves.</p>

<h2 id="chap_62">THE TREATY OF PEACE BETWEEN KING STEPHEN AND PRINCE HENRY (1153).</h2>
</div>

<p class="center b2"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Henry of Huntingdon, <cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">Historia Anglorum</cite>, ed. Arnold,
p. 289. (Rolls Series.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile archbishop Theobald urgently treated with the
king, to induce him to come to terms with the duke, speaking
often with the king in person and with the duke by messenger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>His efforts were seconded by Henry bishop of Winchester,
who before had woefully disturbed the realm by conferring the
crown upon Stephen his brother; now, stirred to repentance
and seeing the whole country ruined by plunder, fire and
slaughter, he shared in the negotiations for peace, to put an
end to the awful evils. Above all, the providence of God,
which makes peace and permits evil, purposing to stay the
scourge that smote England according to her deserts, prospered
their work until their efforts were blessed by the calm of peace
and a treaty confirmed by oaths. Oh! priceless joy, oh!
blessed day! when the illustrious prince, led by the king
himself, was received with honour in the city of Winchester at
the head of a splendid procession of bishops and warriors, amid
the acclamation of a numberless throng of the people. For
the king received him as his adopted son and acknowledged
him heir to the throne. Thence the king brought the duke
with him to London, where he was received with equal joy by
a numberless multitude of people and magnificent processions,
as so great a man deserved. So did the mercy of God shed a
halo of peace and lighten the darkness of the ruined realm of
England.</p>

<p>This accomplished, king Stephen and his new son parted in
joy and affection, to meet again, for this treaty was confirmed
before Christmas. But on the octave of the Epiphany they
met once more at Oxford, after the duke had spent almost a
year in the conquest, or rather the resurrection of England.
There then the chief men of the English, by the king’s
command, did to the duke the homage and fealty due to a lord
saving to the king due honour and fealty during his life.
From this brilliant gathering they joyfully departed to their
own homes, blessed by a new peace. Again after a short
interval of time they met at Dunstable. There a brilliant day
was somewhat clouded. The duke was displeased that the
castles, which had been everywhere built after the death of
king Henry and put to the worst uses, were not destroyed, as
had been determined and confirmed by the solemn treaty of
peace between them; a great part had now been razed, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
castles of some had been spared either by the clemency or the
connivance of the king, whereby their mutual adherence to the
compact seemed to be impaired. The duke, on complaining
hereon to the king, suffered a repulse, but, deferring to his new
father, reluctantly postponed the question, that the light of
their harmony might not seem to be extinguished by him; they
parted peaceably, and not long after, by the king’s licence, the
victorious duke returned to Normandy.</p>

<p>“The compilers have taken a sensible view of their functions.
They give a sufficiency of statutes and documents; but they have
been more particularly at pains to unearth narratives, character-sketches,
and passages of satire or argument. They aim at stimulating
the imagination and at provoking discussion. Teachers will be
grateful to them for avoiding hackneyed material; and it will indeed
be an expert who browses in either of these volumes without finding
that his attention is called to unfamiliar but most attractive sources of
information. For our own part, we have been incited by Mr. Bell to
look up Bradford’s ‘History of Plymouth Plantation,’ and by Mr.
Perrett to send for the ‘Lives of the Norths.’ These volumes are
just of the right length. They contain a hundred and twenty pages
apiece, which is about what the intelligent school-boy may be
expected to assimilate in the course of one term. And each relates to
a period of manageable proportions&mdash;the sort of period that is set for
a ‘Local’ or a ‘Certificate’ examination as a special subject. It would
be difficult for a school-boy, however willing, to work over the whole
of English history with the deliberation which the use of such a source-book
implies. But the occasional study of a short period on these
lines is essential if history is to be made a living subject. The series
that Messrs. Bell are preparing will give to teachers the widest
possible range of choice; for it will contain twenty volumes, the first
dealing with Roman Britain and the last with the years 1901&ndash;1912....
